Economic Principles
===================

.. _`tj`:

:tj: `dtribute`_

Economic supply and demand corresponds to
creation of and selection from a variable (information processing),
which makes economy comparable to other `evolutionary systems`_.
Information per time corresponds to energy.
The variables depend on the system, therefore also the type of energy.

.. _`t1`:

:t1: `decon`_

`Evolutionary systems`_ produce **encapsulations** to reduce energy consumption.
In the economy, encapsulations down to a person are considered.

Further down encapsulations directly or indirectly follow from natural evolution.
The person's intellectual potential and character lead to capabilities through studying.
There should be a feedback from the economy to the genes, i.e. the offspring.
Therefore value create and not fully consumed during lifetime,
should not go to others, but be inherited to offspring.

.. _`infoeconomy`:

:economy:

In physics as in economy **work** is related to energy (satisfaction in economy).

The purpose of work is to satisfy the person's need.
Maximizing a person's freedom is equivalent to maximizing the person's capital.

A free society is the sum over individual freedom.
Maximizing the society's freedom is equivalent to well distributed capital, i.e.
minimizing inequality.

The purpose of economy is to

- maximize society's satisfaction
- with minimal work

Economy is pivoting around *products*

- creation of products (work)
- selection of products (satisfaction = profit)

..  Work needs to be linked to profit.
    But in current economy there is a separate work market,
    that is not linked to profit.

    Furthermore

    - too much competition
    - too little cooperation

    makes satisfaction more work than necessary.

.. _`infomoney`:

:money:

Money is the valuation (pricing) of work in the economy via products.

Valuation of work has a broad range.
The value of work (interaction) depends on

- who you interact with
- how you interact

Who with and how to maximize the personal work value?

- Who relates to fairness between people and to machines (automation)
- How relates to encapsulation, organizationally and by content

Direct interaction (service) has less choice on optimization.
A better work pricing is achieved via products.

Once priced, the resulting money is a promise of economy
based on all current products and services (`fiat money`_).

Stable money requires

- reliability and
- trust

.. _`infoinflation`:

The economy is not capable to keep its promise, because

- development of products continues independently (competition)
- humans limited capability to plan ahead

The result is inflation.

Planning is based on information.
If not based on information it is speculation.
Information about a changing world is temporary.

Speculation and dissipative loss of information makes development non-deterministic.
Nature itself is non-deterministic

- due to limited precision (quantum)
- due to dissipation.

Inflation is not seen in the money figure.
Inflation is a change in the unit (currency) with respect to other units.

.. _`infointerest`:

People should strive to be as reliable as possible,
to be trustworthy economic partners.

Since society is not very reliable,
the money is invested in people (or goods)
that promise to be more reliable than the general economy.
This is encoded in an *interest rate*.

The interest rate should at least balances the inflation rate.

.. _`inforisk`:

There is a risk associated with every endeavour.
That is the reason of inflation.

Risk can be reduced with

- accurate planning
- sticking to the plan

There are physical limits of planning due to limited information.
It is not possible to foresee the effect of an ad,
but it can be measured afterward to change the strategy.

Established products are safer,
because the price and the market is known.
But new product are more profitable.
The profitability of a product can be inferred from the work it allows to save.
Promising products are those that reduce the interactions, the economy.

Planning and development better than the general economy
should reduce the risk below inflation.

.. _`infoinvestment`:

:investment:

Any investment in a promising and well planned product
gives a better `return of investment`_
than the general economy.

Work investment is best priced by the product.

Work can be given a current value in money
by comparing with prices of similar work,
if you want to include work in further calculations,
e.g. to calculate your `return of investment`_ on work.

.. _`infobookkeeping`:

:bookkeeping:

In bookkeeping money is regarded as conserved,
like conservation of energy.
Money flows from one account to another account (posting),
but does not get lost.
If money actually gets lost,
then there is a "loss" account,
to keep the books in order.
One tries to avoid loss, but sometimes it is unavoidable.

Income and expenses are in exchange of an asset of equivalent value,
which is also recorded to keep the total value unchanged.

For financial reporting required by government at the end of a financial period,
accounts need to be closed by postings balancing input and output.
The closing balance is transferred to an opening balance for the new period.

Bookkeeping hinges on pricing of assets.
Well established prices make bookkeeping more easily fit to reality.
Speculative assets may be priced by expectation, maximum or minimum,
or not priced at all,
depending on what is more favorable for taxation.

Only priced values need to be kept in standard bookkeeping.
Non-priced assets can be recorded separately
and priced later by reality.

Work should be priced by the product's success.

Ethics Tests
============

.. _`te`:

:te: *Can an `LE`_ be bought?*

In principle the `LE`_ can be bought via the tributes.
But it is complicated and unlikely to happen.

The value of the `LE`_ consists of

- the product contributors (internal structure)
- the product tributes
- the product customers (external structure)
- other product related assets

The tributes don't have a market price.
An interested buyer could still make an offer.
All contributors can decide independently whether to sell their tributes.

The `LE`_ has little value without the contributor's expertise.
The contributors can freely regroup for other products, also concurrently,
which forms a network across products, i.e. across different `LE`_'s.
Contributors are thus owners of more `LE`_'s.
Getting employed would be a disadvantage for them.

The econ contract demands open development,
which allows new contributors to join.

The customers cannot be bought other than through the product contributors.

.. _`t1`:

:t1: *Is profit mazimization moral in the econ contract?*

There is no separate labor market.
The workers are the owners.

Profit maximization of the `LE`_
means maximizing the profit of each contributor.
Every contributor helps each other to maximize their profit.
This profit maximization is morally good.
