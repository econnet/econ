Ethics Tests
============

.. _`te`:

:te: *Can an `LE`_ be bought?*

In principle the `LE`_ can be bought via the tributes.
But it is complicated and unlikely to happen.

The value of the `LE`_ consists of

- the product contributors (internal structure)
- the product tributes
- the product customers (external structure)
- other product related assets

The tributes don't have a market price.
An interested buyer could still make an offer.
All contributors can decide independently whether to sell their tributes.

The `LE`_ has little value without the contributor's expertise.
The contributors can freely regroup for other products, also concurrently,
which forms a network across products, i.e. across different `LE`_'s.
Contributors are thus owners of more `LE`_'s.
Getting employed would be a disadvantage for them.

The econ contract demands open development,
which allows new contributors to join.

The customers cannot be bought other than through the product contributors.

.. _`t1`:

:t1: *Is profit mazimization moral in the econ contract?*

There is no separate labor market.
The workers are the owners.

Profit maximization of the `LE`_
means maximizing the profit of each contributor.
Every contributor helps each other to maximize their profit.
This profit maximization is morally good.
