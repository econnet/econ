Principles
==========

.. _`tj`:

:tj: energy → `dtribute`_

Economic supply and demand corresponds to
creation of and selection from a variable (information processing),
which makes economy comparable to other `evolutionary systems`_.
Information per time corresponds to energy.
The variables depend on the system, therefore also the type of energy.

.. _`t1`:

:t1: encapsulation → `decon`_, `tribute <#dm>`_

`Evolutionary systems`_ produce **encapsulations** to reduce energy consumption.
In the economy, encapsulations down to a person are considered.

Further down encapsulations directly or indirectly follow from natural evolution.
The person's intellectual potential and character lead to capabilities through studying.
There should be a feedback from the economy to the genes, i.e. the offspring.
Therefore value create and not fully consumed during lifetime,
should not go to others, but be inherited to offspring.

Expertise must be associated to a person, not a company.

.. _`tk`:

:tk: economy → `dproduct`_, `dprocess`_, `dwork`_

In physics as in economy **work** is related to energy.
In economy it produces satisfaction, which is valued to a price in a currency.

The purpose of personal work is to satisfy the person's need via a market's need (product).

Maximizing a person's freedom is equivalent to maximizing the person's capital.
A free society is the sum over individual freedom.
Maximizing the society's freedom is equivalent to well distributed capital, i.e.
minimizing inequality.

The purpose of economy is to

- maximize society's satisfaction
- with minimal work

Economy is pivoting around *products*

- creation of products (work)
- selection of products (satisfaction = profit)

Work on a product is aimed to maximize the return of work investment of the workers.

- Minimize work with open development (cooperation instead of competition).
- Make a good quality product that is needed by the market.

Work is linked to profit by the product.
A separate labor market does not maximize freedom.

Direct work satisfaction is maximized by free choice of work according interest.

.. _`tc`:

:tc: money, how → `dproduct`_, who → `dcontributors`

Money is the valuation (pricing) of work in the economy via products (`fiat money`_).
Gained money from a product sale is a promise of economy (`IOU`_)
to return other products of equivalent value.

Valuation of work has a broad range.
The value of work (interaction) depends on

- who you interact with
- how you interact

Who with and how to maximize the personal work value?

- *Who* relates to 

  - fairness between people
  - machines (automation)

- *How* relates to encapsulation, organizationally and by content

Direct interaction (service) has less choice on optimization.
A better work pricing is achieved via products.

Stable money requires

- reliability and
- trust

.. _`tw`:

:tw: inflation

The economy is not capable to keep its promise, because

- development of products continues independently (competition)
- humans limited capability to plan ahead

The result is inflation.

Planning is based on information,
but information about a changing world is temporary.

If not based on information it is speculation.

Speculation and dissipative loss of information makes development non-deterministic.
Nature itself is non-deterministic

- due to limited precision (quantum)
- due to dissipation

.. _`tu`:

:tu: investment → `dfinancing`_

Since general economy is not very reliable,
the money is invested in people (or goods)
that promise to be more reliable than the general economy.
This is encoded in an *interest rate*
that more than balances the value loss through inflation.

People should strive to be as reliable as possible,
to be trustworthy for investment.
Reliable people or teams offer an interest rate,
that at least balances the inflation rate.
But to offer more than the average economic `growth`_,
is only hinting unreliability and thus risk of loss,
or would reduce the return of work investment.

.. _`tf`:

:tf: risk → `dfinancing`_, `dcontributors`_, `dproduct`_

There is a risk associated with every endeavour.
That is the reason of inflation.

Risk can be reduced with

- accurate planning
- sticking to the plan
- monitoring and adapting the plan

There are physical limits of planning due to limited information.
It is not possible to foresee the effect of an ad,
but it can be measured to change the strategy dynamically.

Established products are safer,
because the price and the market is known.
But new products are more profitable.
The profitability of a product can be inferred from the work it allows to save.
Promising products are those that reduce the interactions, the economy.

Any investment in a promising and well planned product
gives a better `return of investment`_ (ROI)
than the general economic `growth`_.

Work investment has the best return directly from the product market.

.. _`t9`:

:t9: accounting → `dwork`_, `dfinancing`_

In accounting money is regarded as conserved,
like conservation of energy.
Money flows from one account to another account (posting),
but does not get lost.
If money actually gets lost,
then there is a "loss" account,
to keep the books in order.
One tries to avoid loss, but sometimes it is unavoidable.

Income and expenses are in exchange of an asset of equivalent value,
which is also recorded to keep the total value unchanged.

For financial reporting required by government at the end of a financial period,
accounts need to be closed by postings balancing input and output.
The closing balance is transferred to an opening balance for the new period.

Accounting hinges on pricing of assets.
Well established prices make accounting more easily fit to reality.
Speculative assets may be priced by expectation, maximum or minimum,
or not priced at all,
depending on what is more favorable for taxation.

Assets not priced at all need not be kept in standard accounting.

Internal exchanges of goods are not handled by accounting,
but by other enterprise resource planning (`ERP`_).
Work is best treated as an internal good,
because the product's success on the market gives the best price on work.

.. _`tq`:

:tq: efficiency, maximum information → parallel -> `drepo`_

Encapsulations save energy and are thus more efficiency (`t1`_),
but between the encapsulations interaction energy should distribute equally.

A system in equilibrium has maximum entropy, maximum information.
The interactions (energy, money) are equally distributed to all its parts.
All parts have maximum freedom.
They can interact in *parallel*.
They have their own time.

An organizational encapsulation, especially the person, has accumulated expertise (inner energy).
To make most out of its expertise, it needs to apply it as often as possible.
People need to be independent to apply their expertise where ever they choose to.

But to be able to choose, information needs to be provided.
Free access to information on projects,
allows people to *search* and choose tasks according their expertise.

The product repo provides all information

- for contributors to act independently in parallel and
- for non-contributors, to decide where to choose to contribute

The product repo is a content encapsulation
to link product work with the product market (profit).
A content encapsulation by topic like accounting
would place work results outside the product repo,
which would make it harder to link work to the product.

Experts, like accountants, can contribute to more product repos
and thus still concentrate on their field of expertise.
This is made possible by the `cloud`_,
which allows easy sharing of content and work.

.. _`t9`:

:t9: fairness → `no employees`_

The econ contract is founded on basic (economic) principles, i.e. not `ideological`_  (`peconomyofemotions`_, `principles`_).

The econ contract does not enforce any ideas, nor does it demand loyalty or subordination,
but offers a fairer cooperation to those interested (`pchoice`_).

The econ lattice is no huge organization, but pragmatic per product (`pproduct`_).

In the econ contract has no central control, no boss (`pnoboss`_).

The econ has no subordinate roles like employees (`pnoemployment`_).

Base ownership on *relevant* work to fit valuation to reality,
instead of stock `bubbles`_ (`powner`_, `pnostock`_).

Open development avoids abuse of information, reduces effort and increases fairness (`popen`_).

The econ contract demands effort on fairness (`pfair`_).
