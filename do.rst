Governance
==========

.. epigraph:: A society is not democratic unless in all interactions.

`pdt`_ concentrated on content.
Here the focus is on organization of people.

The perspective to economy from a person corresponds to an **inversion** of the economic hierarchy.


.. _`econ`:

:econ:
economic node, interaction node

Specifically the name *econ* implies compliances with the values and rules in this repo.

Econs are formed by cohesion of interaction.
Interaction between econs is coupling.
Coupled econs form an **econ lattice**.

An econ corresponds to a node in a `concept lattice`_.
The members of an econ correspond to the node's intent.
People are top econs.

Interaction is done via content, ultimately via a product.
A member is determined by the contribution of content.

Content encapsulations maps to econs.

- A product related interaction encapsulation is an econ (product part econ, marketing econ, ...)
- A product maps to an econ lattice (**product lattice**).

Every team is an econ, but not vice-versa, as one person is an econ, too.
It is about interaction: The same econ can interact in more econs.
The same person/econ can contribute in more teams/econs.
A small product with one team,
without further organizational encapsulations has n+1 econ members,
the `n` people + the team.

There is organizational effort associated with the formation of a product lattice.
People need to

- find each other and
- get to know each other
- get the same understanding of the process (functioning well together)
- organize econs
- create communication channels (repos, html sites, chat channels, ...)

This effort goes hand in hand with the content organization (product planning).

There is also effort involved,
if common interest and chance brought people together.

A product lattice

- shares the formation effort
- shares the effort to produce the product
- shares the value of the product in the market

In this sense the econ members of a product lattice

- sharedly "own" the product lattice, i.e. themselves

.. _`owner`:

:owner:

Ownership results from the desire to control a resource one needs, one depends on.
Ownership is protected by society, to avoid the stress of constant fights for resources.

The product lattice and the value of the product in the market are resources
all members depend on.

Being member implies being shared owner of the profit of the product sale.

Members sharedly profit from the ownership protection of society's laws.

Owner means co-owner with single-owner as a special case.

- Membership is yes/now.
- Ownership quantifies to share.

Ownership does not imply control over each other.
It refers to the right to profit from the result of the work,
i.e. the market value of the product.

.. _`control`:

By control means decision making.
Decisions need information.

A general principle is: *Those decide that have most information*.
E.g. a developers decide about their parts in the product.
But if others are concerned, too, they get a say.

There can be separate econs in the lattice that care about performance monitoring.
Decisions from the gathered information need to be made by those concerned,
which can be the whole econ lattice.

If more are concerned, decisions are democratic, either

- by direct vote or
- though elected or otherwise agreed delegation

There is an implicit delegation if all agree that

- an econ develops a part of the product or
- takes on another role, like coordinating or marketing

There is **no boss**, neither in an econ, nor in an econ lattice.
Someone coordinating does not decide, but mediates an agreement.

.. _`limited_liability`:

:limited liability:

There are differences of `limited liability`_ between jurisdictions,
so econ defines its own limited liability,
which should be compatible with major jurisdictions.

A limited liability econ lattice (`LLE`_) is independent of
`legal entity`_ acquired in a local jurisdiction.

The `LLE`_'s purpose is to interact with the local government
on behalf of those living in that government area.
For an international econ lattice it might be necessary to create
an `LLE`_ per government.

Initial capital coming from those founding the `LLE`_
are loans to the `LLE`_.

Founding an `LLE`_ must not produce ownership.
Only subsequent working on the product produces ownership,
independent of whether

- founders or
- non-founders

.. _`content`:

:content:

The product lattice is mapped to more repos according content encapsulation,
with one repo a special case.

- governance (rules, monitoring, `SOP`_'s, contracts, licenses, ...)
- finance (expenses, income, ...)
- work shares and algorithms used to calculate ownership
- product records (`DMR`_, `DHF`_, ...)
- marketing
- development

The members of a product lattice need to have access to information that allows them

- to do their work (development and product records)
- to check the fairness (work share's, financial books and marketing)
- interact (governance)

The members have access to all repos, because the repos are a communication channel.
So even if delegation reduces the actual need to access certain repos,
communication to the delegation needs to be able to link to the information.
The content itself is linked across repos.

Others just need access to the development repo(s),
not to information about the product lattice.

.. _`products`:

:products:

An econ lattice does not provide work as service for companies outside its lattice,
because work does not produce ownership in the outside economy.
Instead the product lattice

- produces a finished (technical) product
- maintains and improves the product
- helps in using the product
- possibly recycles the product

The **product lattice** exists during the `product lifetime`_,
from development to recycling.

A new product has a new product lattice.
A new version of a product can also have a new or changed product lattice.

The income for a product version is distributed according the product version's ownership.

If a product gets modified, some work might be replaced.
Then the according worker's share becomes smaller with the new product version.
Ownership vanishes
if (past) contributions stop to be *relevant* for the currently sold product version.

If new people take over the development, their effort will produce income for them in future product versions.
Previous developers will still get their share on relevant work.
Previous developers can still check for fairness.

.. _`license`:

:license:

The license cannot be GPL due to the work shares
that don't allow reselling without fair forwarding of income.

The license should be compatible with GPL
as existing open source software/hardware is the basis.

Software created along the product development,
but not directly linked to the product
should be released as GPL.
These efforts will not be considered in the product profit distribution,
but simplifies the product profit distribution,
because different products do not get linked by such common (software) infrastructure.


Finance
=======

.. _`work`:

:work:

In the econ lattice

- **work produces ownership**
- money investment does **not produce ownership**

.. note:: Work produces ownership.

    There in no employment according outside economy,
    as that produces inequality,
    because the actual value of work is not forwarded to the worker.

    Not using employment is the major difference
    of the econ lattice and tradictional companies.

The actual value of internal work is only determined by the success of the product on the market.
To stop inequality from growing, it is essential

- *not to give a price to work in the outside economy*

because the price decouples work from the actual value of work.

The outside economy is not uniform.
Every country has its own work price.
To extend this idea:

- A company is its own encapsulation and
- needs to have its *own internal price for work*

Producing a product still involves different kinds of work.

When quantifying work internally,

- the kind of work has more weight
- than the person who does the work

Both aspects can be considered with a `performance`_ factor (`p`).

On the other hand people doing different work have more or less the same
financial need to survive in an economy.
The outside economy has a `minimum wage`_.

This is copied to the inside economy.
The inside economy is a separate encapsulation with its

- *own internal minimum wage*

which corresponds to `p=1` and is the unit of internal work (`W_h`, `h` refers to hour).

Work that turns out to be less valuable than the external `minimum wage`_ needs to be

- revalued or
- automated

Automation is important

- to increase the internal work value
- to keep the final product competitive and
- to produce profit to finance new projects

The *internal work value* also considers the tools needed to perform the work.
The person who needs a computer or car to do its work gets a work value that considers these tools.

Internal work records are internal capital: work shares.

Work does not need to be measured in time.
Work can be measured by result, e.g.

- by products sold
- by customers acquired
- by members recruited
- ...

The work shares are recorded in (separate) internal units.
When pricing the product for the external market,
the internal work measures need to be considered
with temporary acceptable conversion factors to the outside price.

How and how precise work is recorded needs to be agreed upon.
There should be an effort in the fair attribution of work,
but how much is up to the members.
Micro-recording and micro-payments produce more effort than value
and thus produce deficit.

Work shares can be

- donated
- inherited
- used as pledge for a loan,
  if accepted by a creditor
- basically also sold,
  but a price is probably hard to agree upon,
  since the actual value in the outside economy is unknown

.. _`work_share`:

:work share:

**Work shares** document the ownership.
Here **share** always means work or contribution shares.

Work shares produce delayed income in an outside currency,
when the product of the work is sold.

Only work is considered that is **relevant** for currently sold product version,

- either current work or
- work in the past

**Relevant** is necessary to make it fit to reality.

**Relevant work** requires the work value to be associated with product parts.
The organizational econ lattice reflects the content topology.

- product lattice -> product
- inner econs -> product parts
- ...
- top econ -> elementary product part

People should contribute to more econs as `diversification`_.

The output from more econs is used in a integrating econ.
Such a integrating econ has

- direct top level econs (integrators) and
- inner econs

as owners.

Ownership share is product ownership share.
Product ownership shares of people (top nodes) are calculated
via the **product lattices** traversing the inner nodes.
This calculation is done for every product version,
as contributions changes between product versions.
The profit distribution is done differently for every product version sold.

The work share is no single paper or data point, but

- calculated through an algorithm that uses
- data recorded throughout the product lattice
- for a product version

Work that is not related to the specific product is its own product that
comes from the outside economy.

.. _`financing`:

:financing:

The major costs for technical products are development.
If developers can afford to wait for the revenue via sale of the finished product,
there is not much money needed.

Before actual income, the money can come from

- loans
- donations

Financing through loans follows from defining ownership via work share.

Money cannot be used to change ownership of an econ lattice.
There is *no owner's equity* in the `balance sheet`_.
Ownership is only defined by work share,
which is calculated from work share data
for every product version.

Money can change ownership indirectly:
If someone is payed by a third party
in exchange of forwarding its work shares to that party.

To keep workers from engaging in such relations

- the prospect of bigger profit if not directly payed should help
- else regular loans to the worker can be granted by the econ lattice, financed by external loans.

Loans don't change ownership.
The profit through ownership is higher than
the interest on loans. Also,
the interest on loans can be considered in the pricing of the product.

- Founders, non-founders, owners or non-owners can give loans to the `LLE`_.
- The `LLE`_ can give loans to the owners, e.g. as wages.

The `balance sheet`_ thus balances

- only assets vs liabilities
- instead of assets vs liabilities and owner's equity

The interest on loans varies, but is at least as high as inflation of the outside economy.

The owners have control over the financial channels (e.g. bank account),
but it is normally delegated to buyers and sellers,
which register the financial flows in the repo,
for everybody to check,
with additional check from specialized fairness checkers.

.. _`econ_value`:

:econ value:

The value of an econ lattice is

- the community
- the work shares defining each owner (with associated potential profit)
- equipment, inventory, ...

There is no need to calculate the full value of an econ lattice,
because it cannot be sold as a whole.
An interested buyer would have to contact every contributor
and agree on a price for its work shares separately.

The community around a product lattice
can freely regroup in other product lattices,
also concurrently.
The community of one product lattice cannot be bought without employing everybody,
but that would mean control from the employer,
which would reduce personal freedom and profit.
It is unlikely that the community would agree to that.

.. _`profit`:

:profit:

Profit is income - expenses of a period.

Expenses are only related to the product.
Investment in big machines not related exclusively to the product,
need to be handled by a separate `LLE`_.

Working tools like the computer or a car belong to the person (top econ).
They are considered in the internal work value.

*Work is not an expense*,
because the profit becomes the reward for the work.

Profit from the period transactions is attributed to owners according current ownership.
This capital attribution

- is a result of ownership and
- does not produce ownership change.

The profit belongs to the owner not to the `LLE`_.
Some profit can be kept in the `LLE`_
as loan from the owners to it `LLE`_,
if owner and `LLE`_ agree to do so.
It needs to be a *loan* instead of *owner's equity*,
because ownership is only reach via work and not money.

Profit maximization of the `LLE`_
means maximizing the profit of each member.
Every member helps each other to maximize their income.

This kind of profit maximization is morally good,
unless it damages to the outside world.
(produces inequality in the outside economy, destroys habitats in nature, ...).

.. _`wages`:

:wages:

Work

- produces ownership and 
- does not produce immediate income.

Wages constitute regular payments to owners, currently contributing or not,
to allow them to use products of the outside economy already before revenue from sales of the econ.

The `LLE`_ corresponding to a econ lattice accepts ownership as pledge for loans.

In an econ lattice,
wages are loans of the `LLE`_ to the owners
and are balanced with profit at the end of the period.
If the econ does not make profit, wages are liabilities forwarded to the next period.
If the `LLE`_ gets bankrupt, then wages are lost.
The risk is thus take by the `LLE`_.

The hight of wages is based on previous profits,
or if the money is available,
based on expected profit.

Increasing wages increases the risk of period loss for the econ.
Period loss means that no profits can be attributed,
rather additional loans need to be taken.

If no loans are granted the `LLE`_ cannot pay wages (any more).
If furthermore external obligations cannot be satisfied, there is the danger of bankruptcy.

Wages are thus a compromise of the owners between

- risk of third party take-over of owners
- risk of diminished wages
- risk of loss of wages or `LLE`_

As profit, also risk must be distributed between owners proportional to ownership.
This means that wages, if any, must be given to all owners proportional to ownership.

The owners decide together the amount of wages to pay, and whether at all.

If wages are payed, there is a minimum wage, e.g. for someone new at an econ,
which, having no ownership yet, would otherwise not get a wage.
As wages are loans, this is not money for free.
But if the `LLE`_ gets bankrupt the money is lost.
The extra risk is taken indirectly by the current owners.
