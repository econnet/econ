.. epigraph:: A society is not democratic unless in all interactions.

.. _`decon`:

Econ
----

Motivated by |pproduct|.

The name *econ* stands for

- a map of the content topology (econ = Economic CONtent)
- to an organizational topology (econ = ECOnomic interaction Node)

But econ also stands for the *ethical values* associated with the interactions.

The perspective to economy is from a person.
Econ is an **inversion** of the usual economic hierarchy:
A company does not own a person, but the person owns companies.
The person is at the top and interactions are its econs,
i.e. econs belong to people working there.

Econs are a cohesions of interactions fitting to the `cohesion`_ of content.
A new econ is

- a sub-content
- demanding prolonged interaction between econs

Econs form a mathematical `lattice`_.
An econ corresponds to a node in a `concept lattice`_.
The contributors correspond to the econ's intent.
*Intent* in `concept lattice`_ are the attributes,
but the English sense of purpose to produce content fits well.

Maximizing `cohesion`_ and minimizing coupling is a way to reduce interactions, i.e. work.
The further down the lattice the less interaction.
The *bottom econ* does the interaction with the market via a tested product.

Interaction is done via content.
An econ member is a content contributor.
A content item is a product part.

Content encapsulations map to organizational encapsulations: econs.

- product (coordination)     ->      bottom econ
- product parts              ->      inner econs
- elementary product part    ->      top econ

An econ stays even if the contributing people (team) change.

With a `concept lattice`_ in mind,
these names are used for relations of econs

contributors
    nodes above.

econs
    nodes below.

partners
    Sideward; nodes linked via content

siblings
    Sideward, nodes linked via contributors


.. _`dcontributor`:

Contributor
-----------

Motivated by |powner|.

**Contributors** to the product are
the owners (of the profit) of the product.

Owner is replaced by **contributor**
to avoid conflict with the existing legal definition.

People engage in econs because of

- common interest and/or
- prospect of profit when selling the product

Normally tech personalities do tech work and
people personalities mediate the network.

A new contributor needs to

- register financial contact to allow profit distribution
- records the effort and/or profit in the repo


.. _`db`:

:db:

There is organizational effort associated with the formation of an econ lattice.
People need to

- find each other
- get to know each other
- get the same understanding of the econ process and values (functioning well together)
- map the product parts to work, i.e. form inner econs
- create communication channels (repo, html sites, chat channels, ...)

The formation effort is recorded to the final product
e.g. by product initiator and/or coordinator, recruiters.

To integrate a contributor into the product development is effort.
Micro-contributors are those that contribute below this effort.
Micro-contributors are not registered contributors
and therefore not considered in the profit distribution.

A product with only micro-contributors is normally a byproduct of a community
who creates the product for their work.
Such a product can do without marketing and profit distribution effort.

Software created along the product development,
but not directly linked to the product
is released separately with GPL license.
The efforts can still be recorded to the product repo,
because needed by the product.
It is a byproduct.
This procedures produces more free software
which means less organizational overhead for future products.

.. _`dl`:

:dl:

The contributors

- commit to the product
- plan the product
- work on the product
- finish the product
- own the product
- profit from the product

Finishing the product is essential to be able to interact with the market.
Becoming a contributor

- is an implicit *promise* to the other contributors
- to stick to the product until finished

Contributors don't work for money.
Contributors work for the product.
Money follows only if a product is finished.

A dropout contributor still gets money,
if the product is finished,
but the risk of not getting finished is higher.

Reliability reduces effort to reorganize.

Reorganization effort is done by the bottom econ.
Being unreliable

- gives the bottom econ a bigger share of profit
- reduces the overall profit/work ratio


.. _`dcontrol`:

Control
-------

Motivated by |pnoboss|.

.. _`dk`:

:dk: 

In an econ, no one has control over someone else.

Control refers to controlling the product related work.
Content is controlled by the contributor of the content.

The product to a large part determines the work that needs to be done.

Contributors

- choose work and/or
- agree on who does what and/or
- use a mediator to come to an agreement

.. _`dp`:

:dp:

Subsequent decision making is based on the principle:

- *Those decide that have most information*.

Affected others are consulted and informed about the decision.

.. _`dq`:

:dq:

If more are concerned, decisions are democratic, either

- by direct vote or
- through elected or otherwise agreed delegation

A decision needs a proposal.
The proposal is worked out by one interested person.

The vote weight of an econ is proportional to the contribution.

.. _`do`:

:do:

There is **no boss**, neither in an econ, nor in the econ lattice.

Someone initiating or coordinating does not decide, but mediates an agreement.
The less coordination needed, the better.

.. _`d8`:

:d8:

There can be separate econs in the lattice
that care about *performance monitoring* based on the product repo.
Decisions from the gathered information are made by those concerned,
which can be the whole econ lattice.

.. _`dproduct`:

Product
=======

Motivated by |pproduct|, |pexisting|, |popen|

The product is the interface between 

- the inside market (contributors) and
- the outside market (customers)

An econ does not provide work as service to an outside company to produce a product
without also profiting from the sales of the product.

The econ lattice

- produces a finished (technical) product
- maintains and improves the product
- helps in using the product
- possibly recycles the product

Product refers to a physical device with a construction effort.

Information is not a product in the econ sense.
Information is for free, i.e. without profit.
The product repo does also have free access.
Software is information and therefore free.
Information needs to be created and studied,
so it is not without effort, though.

.. _`da`:

:da:

The product does not need to be a new product.
An existing market is valuable for planning.
The new open development method

- can make a difference on the market
- can open new directions for the product

.. _`d5`:

:d5:

The product is the output item to the outside economy.
There are also input items from the outside economy.
Work refers only to the conversion of input items to the product.

Only product parts that are developed internally require work and thus an econ.
Product parts from the outside economy
require work to select the right item and supplier,
but there is no need for a separate econ.

.. _`dlegal`:

Legal
=====

Motivated by |pleproduct|, |pnoemployment|

The econ values are not specific to a government.
They need to be compatible (legal) with all involved governments.

The fact that the econ lattice consists of econs,
allows each econ to be in a different government.
The econ, natural person or legal person, cares to interact with its government.

.. _`d0`:

:d0: general partnership

Legally,
contributors implicitly form a `general partnership`_ under `common or civil law`_
(in German: `Gesellschaft b√ºrgerlichen Rechts`_),
bound by this econ contract.

.. _`d4`:

:d4:

A license needs to be part of the product repo
to keep away legal liability issues
resulting from usage of the information in the product repo.

The license doe not apply to the final product.
Conditions of usage of the final product (warranty,...)
is also in the product repo, but under a different name.

.. _`de`:

:de:

The bottom econ founds a company
already during development,
if money flow is involved during the development of the product.

`legal entity`_ (LE) refers to the bottom econ as a company,
else *bottom econ* is used (which can still be a person or a group of people).

The `LE`_ cares about product-specific interaction

- with its government
- creditors
- contributors

.. _`dj`:

:dj:

The `LE`_ is per product.
A new version of the product has the same `LE`_,
but possibly a changed econ lattice.

.. _`di`:

:di:

A `LE`_ is only interface (an address)

- for the government
- for the market

Contributors secure control over the `LE`_

- by this econ contract and/or
- by registering as member to the `LE`_,
  if its `legal entity type`_
  gives control to the members by default (`cooperative`_, `joint-stock company`_)

.. _`dg`:

:dg:

The major interest of a government is taxes.

- When selling the product,
  the `VAT`_ is added to the final product,
  if required by the government

- Taxing of the econ is according location of the econ.
  So profit taxation of a product
  spreads over more governments
  with one as a special case.

.. _`dw`:

:dw:

All product-related cash flow goes via the `LE`_.
The contributors have control over the financial channels (e.g. bank account),
but it is delegated to the `LE`_ and executed by buyers and sellers,
which register the money flows in the repo,
for everybody to check,
with possible additional checks from specialized fairness checkers.

.. _`dv`:

:dv:

The government of the `LE`_'s residence
provides the jurisdiction for potential disputes.
That is not an interest of the government,
but rather of the contributors, creditors and product customers.

.. _`d9`:

:d9: no employment

The `LE`_ **does not have employees**, because

- work on a product
- not producing product profit ownership
- leads to a labor market and
- a separate labor market decouples work from its value
- i.e. the value of the product

In the econ contract

- everything is coupled to the product
- and so is work and its value

Not using employment is the major difference
between the econ lattice and traditional companies.
Profit sharing or advanced payments are usual practices.

.. _`dd`:

:dd: founding

Founding a `LE`_ must not produce product ownership.
Only subsequent product-relevant work produces product ownership.

When founding the `LE`_ the `articles of association`_ contain or reference

- a description of the product the `LE`_ is for
- the econ contract
- the representatives
- how members are added or removed later (only for `cooperative`_)
- additional information as required by the government

A reference allows to change the content unanimously without interacting with the government.
Interaction of the government is effort and must be kept minimal.

If the contributors commit to the econ values by contract,
and the founders quit contributing or are forced to do so by vote of the contributors,
it produces government interactions to update the `LE`_'s registered data
at the government or bank.

It is therefore better to ensure the econ values via membership in the `LE`_.

- The `cooperative`_ seems to be the only `legal entity type`_
  that only requires a list where members are registered.
  The list of members is stored in the product repo.

- A `joint-stock company`_ satisfies the econ values
  if the `articles of association`_ assure that `tributes`_ are the only `stock`_.

.. _`dy`:

:dy: limited liability

An initial `LE`_ cannot be a `limited liability`_ `LE`_,
unless the founders forward `liable capital`_, e.g. as perpetual `bonds`_.
`Liable capital`_ emphasize its purpose as risk capital without defining product ownership.

There is also probably no need for `limited liability`_
before actually interacting with the outside economy.

It is better therefore to found the  `limited liability`_ `LE`_
only before selling the product,

- by conversion from the existing `LE`_
- by creating an additional production and marketing `LE`_ joining the product econ lattice
- by creating an `LE`_ only when actually producing and marketing

When the product development is finished

- most product owners are known through work done
- the `liable capital`_ can be raised by the contributors so far
- `liable capital`_ overlaps with outside economy's definition of `equity`_,
  but we keep the distinction by continuing to use `liable capital`_.

The `LE`_ takes the responsibility for the product according `limited liability`_.

.. _`du`:

:du:

The econs working on product parts have their own responsibility to interact with their government,
whether the same or different.
Concentrating the effort of government interaction to saves effort

- is up to the econs
- not product specific and therefore
- outside the `LE`_

.. _`dcontent`:

Content
=======

Motivated by: efficiency, |pinfo|, |pfair|, |popen|, |pchoice|

All product information is

- in a **written** form
- with **URLs**
- over an IT network

to

- avoid a central figure as communicator
- avoid meetings
- spread information
- link information
- allow recording of effort

.. _`dh`:

:dh: repo

All product related content is in one repo (`cohesion`_).

The product repo contains:

- governance (values, rules, monitoring, contracts, ...)
- financing (expenses, income, `liabilities`_, ...)
- development (hardware, software, test, development docs, usage docs, license, ...)
- production (`SOP`_'s, `DMR`_, `DHF`_, ...)
- marketing

The repo is a communication channel.

The repo links profit with work via content.
It records and provides information about

- effort
- profit


.. _`d6`:

:d6: access

The *contributors* have access to all information.
It allows them

- to do their work (development and production)
- to check the fairness (effort, financing and marketing)
- interact (governance)

*Non-contributors* have also access to all information

- to allow them to choose to contribute
- to avoid repeating effort
- to keep `tibutes`_ together with content
  even if the repo is forked

.. _`ds`:

:ds: fork

Access may not mean direct access,
because it would mean too much effort for the bottom econ
to build trust to too many contributors.

Access includes forking and creating pull requests.

The bottom econ needs to react timely to such pull requests.

.. _`dx`:

:dx: merge

All pull requests get merged at least after mediation.
If there is a conflict, e.g. out of differing technical opinions,
a new product version with a new repo branch is created.

.. _`dwork`:

Work
====

Motivated by |pnoemployment|.

.. _`d2`:

:d2: priceless

The actual value of product-internal work
is only determined by the success of the product on the market.
To stop inequality from growing, it is essential

- *not to give a price to product-internal work using an outside currency*

The outside price of work is decoupled from the actual value of work
and cannot be a reference.

The requirement to distribute profit based on work,
demands to record product-related work in the repo.

.. _`drelevantwork`:

Relevant Work
-------------

Only **relevant work** for the currently sold **product version** matters for the profit distribution.
If new contributors take over, their effort will matter for future product versions.
Previous contributors will still get their profit share on relevant work.
Previous contributors can still check for fairness.

Work is measured by its result.

*Relevancy* requires work to be associated with product parts and thus econs.
When the part is replaced that work becomes irrelevant.
For `diversification`_ people should contribute to more parts.

Work that is not exclusively for the specific product is its own product,
that comes from the outside economy.

.. _`df`:

:df: relevancy

*Relevancy* does not only refer to technical development of the product,
but to all aspects to make a finished product successful on the market

- coordinating
- development
- bookkeeping
- marketing
- building

All product-related activities need to be measured by the its results.

.. _`dtribute`:

Tributes
--------

The **econ contract** requires the `LE`_ to care to

- *attribute* to econs the *contribution* to the product
- *distribute* profit proportionally

All these words contain "tribute".
Therefore the product-internal unit of work result is called tribute.

Tributes document product ownership.

.. _`dm`:

:dm:

Tributes produce delayed income in an outside currency when the product is sold.
Until then tributes can still be

- donated
- inherited
- used as pledge for a loan,
  if accepted by a creditor
- basically also sold,
  but a price is probably hard to agree upon,
  since the actual value in the outside economy is unknown

.. _`dworkunit`:

Work Units
----------

Producing a product involves different kinds of work.
Certain work needs more expertise than other.
When quantifying results internally,

- the kind of work has more weight
- than the contributor who does the work

.. _`dt`:

:dt:

Measuring the performance of a contributor is biased,
as neither experience nor education nor exams
need to reflect in the result.
A less performant contributor will take longer,
i.e. automatically get less profit per time compared to others.
The quality of the result is checked,
therefore fast results of low quality will still take longer to reach accepted quality.

.. _`dn`:

:dn: internal pricing

Every kind of work has its own result unit.

*Work kinds* units can be

- lines of a report (steps taken,...)

- lines of a plan (why, requirements, testing, ...)

- number of records per type (account journal, contributors recruited, customers acquired, ...)

- lines of code (described as much as possible with a language, general is preferred over `DSL`_)

To get to a profit distribution key,
the *work kind* units are internally priced against a standard work unit (**tribute** unit).
The *tribute* unit is described
based on an activity that is frequent for the product.

The tribute unit has no exchange rate to an outside currency.

.. _`d1`:

:d1:

The repo contains an algorithm that 
*automatically* calculates the contributor's tributes from the repo.

This *tribute algorithm* needs to be finalized
latest when pricing the product for the outside market.

Files are ordered by content,
but can be associated by *symbolic links* to

- kind of work
- contributor

Review/change on file(s) of other contributor
is considered by a report file
which is associated to the reviewer or bug fixer.

.. _`dr`:

:dr:

How and how precise work is recorded needs to be agreed upon.
There should be an effort in the fair attribution of work,
but how much is decided by the contributors by proposal and vote.
Micro-recording and micro-payments produce more effort than value
and thus produce deficit.
This is true for accounting in general.

.. _`dtools`:

Tools
-----

Tools have an outside economy price.
They can therefore be accounted with that currency.

Product-specific tools are completely accounted to the product.

But to reduce the accounting effort,
cheap and obvious non-product-specific tools can be subsumed by either

- work kind or
- contributor

More expensive non-product-specific tools are accounted separately with the market price.
E.g. a car can considered by the price of renting the car,
even if it is owned by the contributor
when using it for a product-specific work.

Investment in big machines not exclusively for the product,
are outsourced to a separate company.

.. _`dfinancing`:

Financing
=========

Motivated by |pnostock| and |pprofit|.

The major costs for technical products are development.
If developers can afford to wait for the revenue via sale of the finished product,
there is not much money needed.

Smaller expenses can be financed from the contributors.

Financing through `stock`_ cannot be used, because

- ownership is defined by work (`tributes`_)
- not via capital

In the econ contract usual `stock`_ does not exist,
therefore `stock`_ means `tributes`_.

Before actual income, the money can come from

- bonds
- donations

Money *cannot* be used to change ownership of the `LE`_.
Bonds don't change ownership.
The profit through ownership is higher than
the interest on bonds. Also,
the interest on bonds can be considered in the pricing of the product.

Money can change product ownership indirectly,
if a contributor is payed

- to produce tribute and/or
- to forward tribute to the paying party

Contributors probably avoid such relations by

- the prospect of bigger profit if not payed to renounce on ownership
- by possible regular profit `advances`_ granted by the `LE`_

`Advances`_ are loans, which might

- might only be possible if the `LE`_ finds creditors
- not be accepted by contributors

Contributors can sell only part of their tributes,
if in need of money.

.. _`dz`:

:dz: profit

profit = income - expenses within a financial period.

Expenses are only those related to the product.

*Work is not an expense*,
because the profit becomes the reward for the work.

Profit from the product sales of the period is attributed to contributors for every product version.

The profit

- is buffered in the `LE`_ (`liable capital`_, `retained earnings`_)
- is forwarded to the owners according tributes
- can be reinvested as `ponds`_

The `balance sheet`_ balances

- `assets` versus
- `liabilities`_ and `liable capital`_

.. _`dadvances`:

Advances
--------

Work

- produces ownership and
- delayed profit
- not immediate profit

Profit advances constitute regular payments to owners, currently contributing or not,
to allow them to use products of the outside economy already before revenue from sales of the product.

Advances are only needed if there is no profit yet.

Advances are

- loans of the `LE`_ to the contributor
- are pledged by tributes
- are payed back using profit at the end of the period or forwarded to the next period
- not reward for work (not wages)

Advances must be payed back to the `LE`_,
if the product does never make a profit (e.g. because not completed).
But they might not be recoverable.

The `LE`_ funds advances by donations and `bonds`_.
If the `LE`_ gets bankrupt, `bonds`_ might be lost.
The risk is

- taken by creditors if financed by bonds and
- considered via the interest rate on the bonds

Advances are a compromise for

- risk of third party take-over of contributors
- risk of diminished or no advances
- risk of abandonment of a potentially profitable product

The `LE`_ agrees with the contributors whether to pay advances.
The amount of advances is agreed separately with every contributor.
The information is in the product repo.

.. _`dfairness`:

Fairness Test
=============

Motivated by: |pfair|

Fairness is a development like every other.
Fairness needs

- to be planned, done and tested (`pdt`_) or
- legislative, executive and judicial power
  (`separation of powers`_)

Members of a product team

- test the rules
- can propose changes

If accepted by vote, the changed plan becomes the new plan,
first locally and, if forwarded, also in an upstream fairness repo (e.g. this econ repo)
Fairness is not specific to a product.
A separate repo makes it more reusable.

This is direct legislation.
The planning of the fairness can also be delegated to a *legislative* power.

Practicing fairness in a product team is the direct execution.
One could have an `ombudsman`_ as a delegated *executive* power.
But with direct access to the fairness repo for feedback, it should not be necessary.

With the fairness repo conflicts can be resolved with basic principles
instead of opportunistically improvised arguments.
Conflicts can be resolved directly or mediated through a *judicial* power.
The econ lattice needs to have a **fairness tests** in place.

For a small team open information (work share, financial)
allows everyone to check the fairness.

Organization is done per product.
For a larger products the organization is larger.
The associated larger fairness effort motivates delegation.
Since the fairness is not related to a product,
a separate organization can do fairness checks (`audit`_).
