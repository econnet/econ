Rules
=====

.. _`owner`:

:owner:

Econ ownership results

- from **work** and
- not from capital

Owners are exclusively those
whose work is **relevant** for current transactions of the econ,

- either current work or
- work in the past

Partner or member are synonyms to owner.

There are no employees of an econ.

An econ cannot perform work,
only a person can.
Only a person can be an owner of an econ.
An econ has at least one owner.

.. An econ is determined by common ownership,
   like the node in a concept lattice is determined by its intent.

.. _`information`:

:information:

The owners of an econ have access to information that allows them

- to do their work
- to check the fairness (access to the financial books)

.. _`capital`:

:capital:

Capital comes from

- sale
- loans
- donations

Capital cannot be used to change ownership of an econ.

Also initial capital coming from those founding the company
are loans to the company.
Founding the company does not produce ownership.

Only subsequent working on the company produces ownership, whether

- founders or
- non-founders

.. _`economy`:

:economy:

Economy refers to the outside economy with products of settled prices.

.. _`market`:

:market:

Market refers to the Econ's links to the economy, also with settled prices.

.. _`econvalue`:

:econvalue:

An evaluation method is agreed upon by all members.

The value of a company is

- only based on past events
- expressed in the currency of the economy
- a function of
  - assets with economy prices (considering amortization)
  - assets with non-economy, but internally agreed temporary price

.. _`ownership`:

:ownership:

Ownership is the share on the |econvalue|.

The value of a company is associated to the members according an agreed function of *relevant* work at a time,
it is thus a `partition of unit`_ over time.

Ownership vanishes if

- a person stops contributing and
- past contributions stop to be relevant for transactions.


.. _`profit`:

:profit:

Profit is income - expenses of a period.

Profit from the period transactions is attributed to owners according current ownership.
This capital attribution is a result of ownership and does not produce ownership change.

The attributed capital belongs to the according owner,
but can be kept in the econ as loan to the econ
if econ and owner agree to do so 

Expenses are only those of regular kind, e.g. for office or working material.
Bigger investments, e.g. in special machines, are financed by loans (from owners or non-owners).


.. _`work`:

:work:

There are different kinds of work. Every kind of work is its own asset.
The work assets do not have a price in the outside economy until the econ has established a market.
Internal work contributions constitute internal currencies.
Their is a mapping to the |companyvalue| at all times, but this mapping can change over time.

.. _`wages`:

:wages:

Wages constitute regular payments to owners, currently contributing or not,
to allow them to use products of the outside economy already before revenue from sales of the econ.

Wages are loans of the econ to the owners,
but are accounted for only when the econ period profit is attributed.
If the econ does not make profit, wages are registered to period loss of the econ,
i.e. the econ takes the risk.

Increasing wages increases the risk of period loss for the econ.
Period loss means that no profits can be attributed,
rather additional loans need to be taken.

If no loans are granted the econ cannot pay wages any more.
If furthermore external obligations cannot be satisfied, there is the danger of liquidation.

Wages are thus a compromise of the owners between

- risk of diminished wages
- risk of loss of wages or econ

As profit, also risk must be distributed between owners proportional to ownership.
This means that wages, if any, must be proportional to ownership.

The owners decide together the amount of wages to pay.

There is a minimal wage for someone new at an econ, which having no ownership yet, 
would otherwise not get a wage.
The extra risk is taken indirectly by the current owners.

.. _`loan`:

Founders, non-founders, owners or non-owners can give loans to the econ.
The econ can give loans to the owners (wages).
The interest varies, but is at least as high as inflation of outside economy.
Loans do not change ownership.
