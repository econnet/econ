Econ
----

Motivated by |pproduct|.

econ
  economic node

The name *econ* stands for

- a map of the content topology (econ = Economic CONtent)
- to an organizational topology (econ = ECONomic interactions)

But econ also stands for the *ethical values* associated with the interactions in this topology.

The perspective to economy is from a person.
Econ is an **inversion** of the usual economic hierarchy:
A company does not own a person, but the person owns companies.
The person is at the top and interactions are its econs,
i.e. econs belong to people working there.

Econs are a cohesions of interactions fitting to the `cohesion`_ of content.
A new econ is

- a sub-content
- demanding prolonged interaction between econs

Econs form a mathematical `lattice`_.
An econ corresponds to a node in a `concept lattice`_.
The contributors correspond to the econ's intent.
*Intent* in `concept lattice`_ are the attributes,
but the English sense of purpose to produce content fits well.

Maximizing `cohesion`_ and minimizing coupling is a way to reduce interactions, i.e. work.
The further down the lattice the less interaction.
The bottom *econ* does the interaction with the outside market via a tested product.

Interaction is done via content.
An econ member is a content contributor.
A content item is a product part.

Content encapsulations map to organizational encapsulations: econs.

- product (coordination)     ->      bottom econ
- product parts              ->      inner econs
- elementary product part    ->      top econ

An econ stays even if the contributing people (team) change.

With a `concept lattice`_ in mind,
these names are used for relations of econs

.. _`dcontributor`:

Contributor
-----------

Motivated by |powner|.

**Contributors** to the product are
the owners of the profit of the product.

Owner is replaced by **contributor**
to avoid conflict with the existing legal definition.

People engage in econs because of

- common interest and/or
- prospect of profit when selling the product

Normally tech personalities do tech work and
people personalities mediate the network.

There is organizational effort associated with the formation of an econ lattice.
People need to

- find each other
- get to know each other
- get the same understanding of the econ process and values (functioning well together)
- map the product parts to work, i.e. form inner econs
- create communication channels (repo, html sites, chat channels, ...)

The formation effort is recorded to the final product for the outside economy,
e.g. by product initiator and/or coordinator, recruiters.
Internal economy consists of
product-related work up to the product transaction to the outside economy.

To integrate a contributor into the product development is effort.
Micro-contributors are those that contribute below this effort.
Micro-contributors are not registered contributors
and therefore not considered in the profit distribution.

A product with only micro-contributors can do without profit distribution effort.

.. _`dcontrol`:

Control
-------

Motivated by |pnoboss|.

In an econ, control means decision making.
Decisions need information.

A general principle is: *Those decide that have most information*.
E.g. developers decide about their parts in the product.

If others are concerned, they are consulted and informed about the decision.

If more are concerned, decisions are democratic, either

- by direct vote or
- through elected or otherwise agreed delegation

A decision needs a propose. The proposal is worked out by one person.

There is **no boss**, neither in an econ, nor in the econ lattice.

Someone initiating or coordinating does not decide, but mediates an agreement.
The less coordination needed, the better.

There can be separate econs in the lattice that care about *performance monitoring*.
Decisions from the gathered information are made by those concerned,
which can be the whole econ lattice.

Reliability reduces effort to reorganize.
Reorganization effort is done by the bottom econ.
Being unreliable

- gives the bottom econ a bigger share of profit
- reduces the overall profit/work ratio

.. _`dproduct`:

Product
=======

Motivated by |pproduct|, |pexisting|.

The product is the interace between 

- the inside market (contributors) and
- the outside market (customers)

An econ does not provide work as service to an outside company to produce a product
without also profiting from the sales of the product.

The econ lattice

- produces a finished (technical) product
- maintains and improves the product
- helps in using the product
- possibly recycles the product

The product does not need to be a new product.
An existing market is valuable for planning.
The new open development method

- can make a difference on the market
- can open new directions for the product

The product is the output item to the outside economy.
There are also input items from the outside economy.
Work refers only to the conversion of input items to the product.

Only product parts that are developed internally require work and thus an econ.
Product parts from the outside economy
require work to select the right item and supplier,
but there is no need for a separate econ.

A new product has a new `LE`_ and a new econ lattice,
as every econ corresponds to a product work part.

A new version of a product has the same `LE`_,
but possibly a changed econ lattice.


.. _`dlegal`:

Legal
=====

Motivated by |pleproduct|, |pnoemployment|

The econ rules are not specific to a government.
They need to be compatible (legal) with all involved governments.

The fact that the econ lattice consists of econs,
allows each econ to be in a different government.

The bottom econ should be

- a `legal entity`_ (LE)
- not a natural person

There is one `LE`_ per product.

The major interest of a government is taxes.

- All product-related cash flow needs to go via the `LE`_,
  which records it in the product repo.

- Selling the product adds the `VAT`_ to the final product
  if required by the government

- Taxing of the econ is according location of the econ.
  So profit taxation of a product
  spreads over more governments
  with one as a special case.

The government of the `LE`_ provides the jurisdiction for potential disputes.
That is not an interest of the government,
but rather of the econ, creditors or product customers.

The `LE`_ is only interface (an address)

- for the government
- for the market

Contributors secure control over the `LE`_

- by contract or
- by choosing a `legal entity type`_ giving control to the members (e.g. `cooperative`_)

The `LE`_ **does not have employees**.

Founding the `LE`_ produces

- ownership of the `LE`_ according usual legislation
- but must not produce product ownership

Only subsequent product-relevant work produces product ownership.

Profit can be kept in the `LE`_

- as a loan granted to the `LE`_ (bond)
- as `liable capital`_ for `limited liability`_

An initial `LE`_ cannot be a `limited liability`_ `LE`_,
unless the founders forward `liable capital`_, e.g. as perpetual `bonds`_.
Here `liable capital`_ is used to emphasize its purpose as risk capital without defining ownership.
It is better to make the `LE`_ to a `limited liability`_ `LE`_
only before selling the product, because then

- the product owners are known through work done
- the `liable capital`_ can be shared between all contributors
- `liable capital`_ overlaps with outside economy's definition of `equity`_,
  but we keep the distinction by continuing to use `liable capital`_.
- there is no need for `limited liability`_ before actually interacting with the outside economy

The `LE`_ takes the responsibility for the product according `limited liability`_.

The econs working on product parts have their own responsibility to interact with their government,
whether the same or different.
Concentrating the effort of government interaction to saves effort

- is up to the econs
- not product specific and therefore
- outside the `LE`_

.. _`dcontent`:

Content
=======

Motivated by: efficiency, |pinfo|, |pfair|, |popen|, |pchoice|

All product information is

- in a **written** form
- with **URLs**
- over an IT network

to

- avoid a central figure as communicator
- avoid meetings
- spread information
- link information
- allow recording of effort

.. _`drepo`:

Repo
----

All product related content is in one repo (`cohesion`_).
The content is linked with URLs.

The product repo contains:

- governance (values, rules, monitoring, contracts, ...)
- financing (expenses, income, `liabilities`_, ...)
- development (hardware, software, test, development docs, usage docs, license, ...)
- production (`SOP`_'s, `DMR`_, `DHF`_, ...)
- marketing

The repo is a communication channel.

The repo links profit with work via content.
Record and provide access to information about

- effort
- profit

.. _`daccess`:

Access
------

The *contributors* have access to all information.
It allows them

- to do their work (development and production)
- to check the fairness (effort, financing and marketing)
- interact (governance)

*Non-contributors* have also access to all information

- to allow them to choose to contribute
- to avoid repeating effort
- to keep tibutes together with content
  even if the repo is forked or content extracted

Contributor does not only mean developer,
but also those doing coordinating, bookkeeping, marketing, building, selling (not retail).
A non-contributor becomes a contributor based on any of the mentioned activities.

A new contributor needs to

- register financial contact to allow profit distribution
- records the effort and/or profit in the repo

All product-related actual financial flow goes via the
bank account of the product `LE`_.

.. _`dforking`:

Forking
-------

Access may not mean direct access,
because it would mean too much effort for the `LE`_
to build trust to too many contributors.

Access includes forking and creating pull requests.

The `LE`_ needs to react timely to such pull requests.

All pull requests get merged at least after mediation.
If there is a conflict, e.g. out of differing technical opinions,
a new product version with a new repo branch is created.

.. _`dwork`:

Work
====

Motivated by |pnoemployment|.

Not using employment is the major difference
between the econ lattice and traditional companies.
Profit sharing or advanced payments are usual practices.

The actual value of internal work is only determined by the success of the product on the market.
To stop inequality from growing, it is essential

- *not to give a price to product-internal work using an outside currency*

The outside price of work is decoupled from the actual value of work
and cannot be a reference.

The requirement to distribute profit based on work,
demands to record product-related work in the repo.

Software created along the product development,
but not directly linked to the product
is released separately with GPL license.
The efforts can still be recorded to the product repo,
because needed by the product.

.. _`dtribute`:

Tributes
--------

The **econ contract** requires the `LE`_ to care to

- *attribute* to econs the *contribution* to the product version (tributes)
- *distribute* profit proportionally

Tributes are internal records for product-related efforts stored in the repo.

Tributes document the product ownership.

The tribute record consists of:

- quantity
- product internal work unit

How and how precise work is recorded needs to be agreed upon.
There should be an effort in the fair attribution of work,
but how much is democratically decided by the contributors.
Micro-recording and micro-payments produce more effort than value
and thus produce deficit.

Tributes produce delayed income in an outside currency when the product is sold.
Until then tributes can still be

- donated
- inherited
- used as pledge for a loan,
  if accepted by a creditor
- basically also sold,
  but a price is probably hard to agree upon,
  since the actual value in the outside economy is unknown

.. _`dworkunit`:

Work Units
----------

A basic work unit (*tribute unit*) is described (not valued)
based on work that is frequent in the product development.
The tribute unit is not yet priced by the product sales to the outside economy.

Producing a product involves different kinds of work.
When quantifying work internally,

- the kind of work has more weight
- than the person who does the work

Both aspects can be considered with a `performance`_ factor (`p`)
that maps the *tribute unit* to the **work unit** based on

- a specific work done by
- a specific person using
- a specific personal tool

`p` includes the tools required to perform the work.
The person who needs a computer to do its work
gets a `p` that accounts for it.

Prefer measures of contribution not related to time

- products sold

- customers acquired

- contributors recruited

- Thoughts, steps taken,...
  can be written and thus measured in content

- Reusable content, also in other products,
  becomes more valuable for the contributor

The outside economy has a `minimum wage`_.
Work turning out to be less valuable than the outside economy's `minimum wage`_,

- is revalued or
- automated

Automation is used

- to increase the performance factor (`p`)
- to keep the final product competitive and
- to produce profit for contributors (to allow them to work on new products)

Latest when pricing the product for the outside market,
the internal work units are considered

- in the product price
- in relating the work units to the *tribute unit* (`p`)

In this process temporary and acceptable conversion factors to the outside work price are used.

.. _`drelevantwork`:

Relevant Work
-------------

Tributes only consider **relevant work** for the currently sold **product version**,

- either current work or
- work in the past

*Relevancy* is necessary to make it fit to reality.

*Relevancy* requires the tributes to be associated with product parts and thus econs.
When the part is replaced that work becomes irrelevant.
For `diversification`_ people should contribute to more parts.

*Relevancy* does not only refer to technical development of the product,
but to all aspect to make the product successful on the market.
E.g. it includes marketing efforts.

Work that is not related to the specific product is its own product that
comes from the outside economy.

Product tribute vanishes
if (past) contributions stop to be *relevant* for the currently sold product version.

If new contributors take over, their effort will produce income for them in future product versions.

Previous contributors will still get their profit share on relevant work (tribute).
Previous contributors can still check for fairness.

Final tributes are calculated per product version,
as contributions change between product versions.

The product repo has a "tribute" file updated before fixing the version.

The profit distribution is done

- separately for every product sold
- based on the tribute of the product version


.. _`dfinancing`:

Financing
=========

Motivated by |pnostock| and |pprofit|.

The major costs for technical products are development.
If developers can afford to wait for the revenue via sale of the finished product,
there is not much money needed.

Smaller expenses can be financed from the owners.

Before actual income, the money can come from

- bonds
- donations

Financing through `stock`_ cannot be used, because

- ownership is defined by work (tributes)
- not via capital

Money cannot be used to change ownership of the `LE`_.
Bonds don't change ownership.
The profit through ownership is higher than
the interest on bonds. Also,
the interest on bonds can be considered in the pricing of the product.

Money can change ownership indirectly:
If a worker is payed

- to produce tribute and
- to forward tribute to the paying party

To keep workers from engaging in such relations

- the prospect of bigger profit if not directly payed should help
- else regular profit advances to the worker can be granted by the `LE`_

The `balance sheet`_ balances

- `assets` versus
- `liabilities`_ and `liable capital`_

`retained earings`_ per default becomes `liable capital`_.
unless distributed according tributes.
The owners can then re-invest it as `bonds`.

The interest on loans varies (bonds, profit advances),
but is at least as high as inflation of the outside economy.

The owners have control over the financial channels (e.g. bank account),
but it is normally delegated to buyers and sellers,
which register the financial flows in the repo,
for everybody to check,
with additional checks from specialized fairness checkers.

.. _`deconvalue`:

Company Value
-------------

The value of the `LE`_

- the product econ lattice (internal structure)
- the product tributes
- the product customers (external structure)
- assets

There is no need to calculate the full value of an econ lattice,
because it cannot be sold as a whole.
An interested buyer would need to agree
on a price for every contributor's tribute separately.

Even if a buyer would manage that,
to employ the contributors with the expertise would even be harder.

The contributors can freely regroup for other products, also concurrently,
which forms a network across products, i.e. across different `LE`_'s.
Contributors are thus owners of more `LE`_,s.

The customers cannot be bought other than through the product contributors.

.. _`dprofit`:

Profit
------

`LE`_ period: profit = income - expenses.

Expenses are only related to the product.
Investment in big machines not related exclusively to the product,
need to be handled by a separate `LE`_ and outsourced to it.

Working tools like the computer or a car belong to the person (top econ).
They are considered in the performance factor (`p`).

*Work is not an expense*,
because the profit becomes the reward for the work.

Profit from the product sales of the period is attributed to owners for every product version.
This capital attribution

- is a result of ownership and
- does not produce ownership change.

The profit

- first belongs to the `LE`_ (`retained earnings`_)
- is forwarded to the owners according tributes
- can be reinvested as `ponds`_

Profit maximization of the `LE`_
means maximizing the profit of each member.
Every member helps each other to maximize their profit.
This kind of profit maximization is morally good,
unless it damages to the outside world.

.. _`dadvances`:

Advances
--------

Work

- produces ownership and
- delayed profit
- not immediate profit

Profit advances constitute regular payments to owners, currently contributing or not,
to allow them to use products of the outside economy already before revenue from sales of the product.

The `LE`_ corresponding to a product accepts tributes as a pledge for profit advances.

Advances are

- loans of the `LE`_ to the contributor
- are payed back using profit at the end of the period or forwarded to the next period
- not reward for work (not wages)

Advances must be payed back to the `LE`_,
if a contributor stops contributing
before the product is finished, i.e. ready for the market.

If the `LE`_ gets bankrupt, then profit advances might be unrecoverable.

The risk is

- taken by creditors if financed by bonds and
- considered via the interest rate on the bonds

The amount of profit advances is based on

- previous profits or
- expected profit, if the money is available

Advances are a compromise for

- risk of third party take-over of contributors
- risk of diminished or no advances
- risk of abandonment of a potentially profitable product

  As development is public the results might be reused by someone even after abandonment.
  Since the licence demands distribution of profit according tributes,
  there is a slight change that a fair other econ lattice continues later.

The `LE`_ agrees with the contributors whether to pay advances.
The amount of advances is agreed separately with every contributor.
The information is public.

.. _`dfairness`:

Fairness Test
=============

Motivated by: |pfair|

Fairness is a development like every other.
Fairness needs

- to be planned, done and tested (`pdt`_) or
- legislative, executive and judicial power
  (`separation of powers`_)

Members of a product team

- test the rules
- can propose changes

If accepted by vote, the changed plan becomes the new plan,
first locally and, if forwarded, also in an upstream fairness repo (e.g. this econ repo)
Fairness is not specific to a product.
A separate repo makes it more reusable.

This is direct legislation.
The planning of the fairness can also be delegated to a *legislative* power.

Practicing fairness in a product team is the direct execution.
One could have an `ombudsman`_ as a delegated *executive* power.
But with direct access to the fairness repo for feedback, it should not be necessary.

With the fairness repo conflicts can be resolved with basic principles
instead of opportunistically improvised arguments.
Conflicts can be resolved directly or mediated through a *judicial* power.
The `LE`_ needs to have a **fairness tests** in place.

For a small team open information (work share, financial)
allows everyone to check the fairness.

Organization is done per product.
For a larger products the organization is larger.
The associated larger fairness effort motivates delegation.
Since the fairness is not related to a product,
a separate organization can do fairness checks (`audit`_).
