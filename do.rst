.. _`evolution`:

:evolution:

Economic supply and demand corresponds to
creation of and selection from a variable.

Information processing per time is energy.
In economy this energy is a person's (brain) work,
which needs fuel that indirectly comes from money,
or more generally capital (including different currencies and other assets).

Dynamic systems produce encapsulations to reduce energy consumption.
In the economy, encapsulations down to a person are considered.

.. _`economy`:

:economy:

The purpose of economy is to provide for a person.
Maximizing a person's freedom is equivalent to maximizing his capital.

A free society is the sum over idividual freedom.
Maximizing the society's freedom is equivalent to well distributed capital, i.e.
minimizing inequality.

The perspective from the person corresponds to an **inversion** of the economic hierarchy.

.. _`econ`:

:econ:
economic node, interaction node

Econ can be replaced by interaction in most places.

`pdt`_ concentrated on content.
Here the focus is on organization of people.

Specifically an econ is a organizational unit
where people or other econs interact
as specified in this repo.

Econs are formed by cohesion of interaction.
Interaction between econs is coupling.
Coupled econs form an **econ lattice** or **lattice**.

An econ corresponds to a node in a `concept lattice`_.
The members of an econ correspond to the node's intent.
People are top econs.

Interaction is done via content, via a product.
A member is determined by the contribution of content.
Content encapsulations maps to econs.

- A product part maps to an econs.
- A product maps to an econ lattice (**product lattice**)

There is organizational effort associated with the formation of an econ.
People need to

- find each other and
- get to know each other
- functioning well together

There is also effort involved,
if common interest and chance brought people together.

An econ lattice

- shares the formation effort
- shares the value of the econ lattice
- shares the effort to produce content (the product)
- shares the value of the product in the market

In this sense the econ members 

- sharedly *own* the econ
- sharedly make decisions

  - either by direct vote or
  - by delegation

There is an implicit delegation if all agree that

- an econ develops a part of the product or
- takes on another role, like coordinating or marketing

There is no boss.
Someone coordinating does not decide, but mediates an agreement.

.. _`owner`:

:owner:

Ownership results from the desire to control a resource one needs, one depends on.
Ownership is protected by society, to avoid the stress of constant fights for resources.

The econ lattice and the value of the product in the market are resources
all members depend on.
Being member implies being shared owner.
Members sharedly profits from the ownership protection of society's laws.

Owner means co-owner with single-owner as a special case.

- Membership is yes/now.
- Ownership quantifies to share.

.. _`work`:

:work:

In physics work is another name for energy, which is information processing.
In economy terms: work is money.

In the econ lattice work produces ownership.
Letting work produce ownership instead of money,
gives workers a say on the distribution of work value (profit) to the workers.

.. note:: Work produces ownership.

    In a econ lattice work (interacting) in an econ produces share on the econ value.

    There in no employment according outside economy,
    as that produces inequality,
    because the actual value of work is not forwarded to the worker.

    Not using employment is the major difference
    of the econ lattice and tradictional companies.


- Work shares do not have a price in the outside economy until the product has established a market
- Work shares constitute internal capital

There are different kinds of work.
Work does not need to be measured in time.
Work could also be measured by result, e.g. 

- by lines of code
- by products sold
- by customers acquired
- by members recruited
- by boards soldered
- ...

The work shares could be

- recorded in separate measures and valued when pricing the product or
- have a continuous value with an *internal currency*

How and how precise work is recording needs to be agreed upon.
There should be an effort in the fair attribution of work,
but how much is up to the members.
It can also be decided separately for every econ in an econ lattice.

Work shares can be

- donated
- inherited
- basically also sold,
  but since the actual value in the outside economy is unknown a price is probably hard to agree upon

.. _`share`:

:share:

**Work shares** document the ownership.
Here **share** always means work or contribution shares.

Work shares produce delayed income in an outside currency,
when the product of the work is sold.

Only work is considered that is **relevant** for current sale,

- either current work or
- work in the past

A more complex product needs organizational encapsulations, inner econs.
The output of more econs is used in a integrating econ.
Such a integrating econ has

- direct top level econs (integrators) and
- inner econs

as owners.

Ownership share consists of product ownership shares.
Product ownership shares of people (top nodes) are calculated from **product lattices**
considering inner nodes.
As contributions change over time, this calculation cannot be done in advance,
but it is done for every sold product.

The share is no single paper or datum, but 

- calculated through an algorithm that uses
- data recorded throughout the product lattice

.. _`product`:

:product:

An econ does not provide work as service for companies outside its lattice,
because work does not produce ownership in the outside economy.
Instead the lattice produces

- finished (technical) products
- helps in using the products
- maintains these products
- possibly recycles these products

The **product lattice** exists during the `product lifetime`_,
from development to recycling.

A new product has a new product lattice.

.. _`market`:

:market:

Market is a link to the outside economy.

A product

- has a market
- has a price in the market (more or less settled)

The product market produces income.
The produt income is distributed according current product ownership.

.. _`openness`:

:openness:

An econ lattice develops its products openly.

This also includes hardware.
Hardware should first be simulated,
but definitely also needs physical prototyping and testing effort.
This is considerable effort that should not need to be repeated.

Development is done by a central repo accessible to everybody.

Outside people can build on existing product development effort.
Their contributions makes them automatically owners of the product lattice.

Construction and marketing is part of the product effort
and is recorded in the central repo,
whether done by the original econ lattice or the newcomers.

Sales are forwarded according ownership,
which includes also development and testing effort.

Changes in the central repo might not be accepted in
by the existing econ lattice, e.g. out of differing technical opinions.
Then the contributors can fork the product.
Forking must keep all the records of previous relevant work.
Income from sales are forwarded to owners on every fork.

Existing economic links cannot be forked as easily as a product.
Still, existing owners need to have a good reason not to accept a contribution,
because

- well motivated product forking might also drag along the economic links
- product forks

  - increase effort
  - decrease profit

Benefits of openness:

- People from the outside economy can join the/a econ lattice easily

- If joining due to techical interest, this interest can be developed,
  because the invested time is payed

- Formation of a new econ lattices (community) is easier

- Creating competing solutions allows to select the best solution

- Development becomes faster (less burocracy, less reinvention)

- The final product becomes more competitive (cheaper, better)

The product repo contains

- a license
- technical instructions

explaining

- how contributions lead to ownership
- how sales is forwarded according ownership

and more generally how development is done

Therefore the license cannot be GPL,
but it should be compatible with GPL 
as existing open source software is the basis.

Software created along the product development,
but not directly linked to the product
should be released as GPL.
These efforts will not be considered in the product profit distribution,
but simplifies the product profit distribution,
because different products do not get linked by such common (software) infrastructure.

.. _`information`:

:information:

The members of an econ lattice need to have access to information that allows them

- to do their work
- to check the fairness (access to the financial books)

The central product repo contains

- all the rules
- all the work share
- algorithms used to calculate ownership
- financial books (expenses, income, ...)


.. _`fairness`:

:fairness:

Prerequisite for fairness is information,
for plan, do, test or
using the idea of `separation of powers`_,
for legislative, executive and judicial power.

The rules constitute the *plan*.
A separate repo for the rules, makes them more reusable (this repo).
Everybody can change the rules and create a pull request.
If accepted by vote, the changed plan becomes the new plan.
This is (direct) *legislative* power.

Contributors are members and form the *executive* power.

There is the need to test the plan,
also regarding fairness.
This corresponds to the *judicial* power.

For a small econ or econ lattice
open information (work share, financial, algorithms)
allows everyone to check the fairness.

For larger econ lattices
the extra effort motivates a

- a separate econ that does the (financial) planning
- a separate econ that does the fairness check

.. _`money`:

:money:

The major costs for tec products are development.
If developers affort to wait for the revenue via sale of finished products,
there is not much money needed.

Before that money can come from

- loans
- donations

Money cannot be used to change ownership of an econ lattice directly.
It can be done indirectly, if someone is payed by a third party
in exchange of forwarding his work shares to that party.

The prospective of bigger profit if not directly payed
should keep developers from engaging in such relations.

Another method is wages financed by loans.
Loans are better, because they don't change ownership.
The profit through ownership is higher than
the interest on loans. Also,
the interest on loans can be considered in the pricing of the product.

.. _`limited_liability`:

:limited liability company:

An `LLC`_ have an own `legal entity`_.

Initial capital coming from those founding the company
are loans to the legal entity company.

Founding an `LLC` must not produce ownership.
Only subsequent working on the company produces ownership,
independent of whether

- founders or
- non-founders

The owners have control over the financial channels (bank account),
but it is normally delegated to buyers and sellers,
which register the financial flows in the repo,
for everybody to check with additional check from specialized fairness checkers.

.. _`econ_value`:

:econ value:

The value of a econ lattice is

- the community
- the work shares of each owner (with associated potential profit)
- equipment, inventory, ...

There is no need to calculate the full value of an econ lattice,
because the econ lattice cannot be sold as a whole.
An interested buyer would have to contact everybody
in the community and agree on a price for his work shares separately.
He cannot buy the community without employing (enslaving) everybody.

The value of a company is associated to the members
according an agreed function of *relevant* work at a time,
it is thus a `partition of unity`_ over time × people.

Ownership vanishes if

- a person stops contributing and
- past contributions stop to be relevant for transactions

.. _`profit`:

:profit:

Profit is income - expenses of a period.

Profit from the period transactions is attributed to owners according current ownership.
This capital attribution

- is a result of ownership and
- does not produce ownership change.

The attributed capital belongs to the according owner,
but can be kept in the `legal entity`_ as loan to it
if owner and entity agree to do so.

Expenses are only those of regular kind, e.g. for office or working material.
Bigger investments, e.g. in special machines, are financed by loans (from owners or non-owners).

.. _`wages`:

:wages:

Ownership does not produce immediate income.
Ownership can be used as pledge for a loan though, if accepted by a creditor.

The `LLC`_ corresponding to a econ lattice accepts ownership as pledge.

Wages constitute regular payments to owners, currently contributing or not,
to allow them to use products of the outside economy already before revenue from sales of the econ.

Wages are loans of the `LLC`_ to the owners,
but are accounted for only when the econ period profit is attributed.
If the econ does not make profit, wages are registered to period loss of the econ,
i.e. the `LLC`_ takes the risk.

Increasing wages increases the risk of period loss for the econ.
Period loss means that no profits can be attributed,
rather additional loans need to be taken.

If no loans are granted the `LLC`_ cannot pay wages any more.
If furthermore external obligations cannot be satisfied, there is the danger of liquidation.

Wages are thus a compromise of the owners between

- risk of third party take-over of owners
- risk of diminished wages
- risk of loss of wages or `LLC`_

As profit, also risk must be distributed between owners proportional to ownership.
This means that wages, if any, must given to all owners proportional to ownership.

The owners decide together the amount of wages to pay and whether at all.

If wages are payed, there is a minimal wage for someone new at an econ,
which, having no ownership yet,
would otherwise not get a wage.
As wages are loans, this is not money for free.
But if the `LLC`_ does not make profit in the period,
the money is lost.
The extra risk is taken indirectly by the current owners.

.. _`loan`:

:loan:

Founders, non-founders, owners or non-owners can give loans to the `LLC`_.
The `LLC`_ can give loans to the owners (wages).
The interest varies, but is at least as high as inflation of outside economy.
Loans do not change ownership.
