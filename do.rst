.. _`evolution`:

:evolution:

Economic supply and demand corresponds to
creation of and selection from a variable (information processing),
which makes economy comparable to other
`evolutionary systems`_.

In physics work is another name for energy.
This can be generalized to `evolutionary systems`_ with information processing.
The variables depend on the system,
therefore also the energy.

In economy the energy is a person's (brain) work,
which needs fuel that indirectly comes from money,
or more generally capital (including different currencies and other assets).

`Evolutionary systems`_ produce encapsulations to reduce energy consumption.
In the economy, encapsulations down to a person are considered.

.. _`economy`:

:economy:

The purpose of economy is to provide for a person.
Maximizing a person's freedom is equivalent to maximizing his capital.

A free society is the sum over individual freedom.
Maximizing the society's freedom is equivalent to well distributed capital, i.e.
minimizing inequality.

The perspective from the person corresponds to an **inversion** of the economic hierarchy.

.. _`econ`:

:econ:
economic node, interaction node

`pdt`_ concentrated on content.
Here the focus is on organization of people.

Specifically an econ is a organizational unit
where people or other econs interact
as specified in this repo.

Econs are formed by cohesion of interaction.
Interaction between econs is coupling.
Coupled econs form an **econ lattice**.

An econ corresponds to a node in a `concept lattice`_.
The members of an econ correspond to the node's intent.
People are top econs.

Interaction is done via content, via a product.
A member is determined by the contribution of content.
Content encapsulations maps to econs.

- A product part maps to an econs.
- A product maps to an econ lattice (**product team**)

There is organizational effort associated with the formation of a product team
People need to

- find each other and
- get to know each other
- functioning well together

There is also effort involved,
if common interest and chance brought people together.

A product team

- shares the formation effort
- shares the effort to produce the product
- shares the value of the product in the market

In this sense the product team

- sharedly "owns" itself
- sharedly makes decisions

  - either by direct vote or
  - by delegation

There is an implicit delegation if all agree that

- an econ develops a part of the product or
- takes on another role, like coordinating or marketing

There is **no boss**, neither in an econ, nor in an econ lattice.
Someone coordinating does not decide, but mediates an agreement.

.. _`owner`:

:owner:

Ownership results from the desire to control a resource one needs, one depends on.
Ownership is protected by society, to avoid the stress of constant fights for resources.

The product team and the value of the product in the market are resources
all members depend on.
Being member implies being shared owner.
Members sharedly profit from the ownership protection of society's laws.

Owner means co-owner with single-owner as a special case.

- Membership is yes/now.
- Ownership quantifies to share.

.. _`work`:

:work:

In the econ lattice

- **work produces ownership**
- money investment does **not produce ownership**

.. note:: Work produces ownership.

    There in no employment according outside economy,
    as that produces inequality,
    because the actual value of work is not forwarded to the worker.

    Not using employment is the major difference
    of the econ lattice and tradictional companies.

The actual value of internal work is only determined by the success of the product on the market.
To stop inequality from growing, it is essential

- *not to give a price to work in the outside economy*

because the price decouples work from the actual value of work.

The outside economy is not uniform.
Every country has its own work price.
To extend this idea:

- A company is its own encapsulation and
- needs to have its *own internal price for work*

Producing a product still involves different kinds of work.

When quantifying work internally,

- the kind of work has more weight
- than the person who does the work

Both aspects can be considered with a `performance`_ factor (`p`).

On the other hand people doing different work have more or less the same
financial need to survive in an economy.
The outside economy has a `minimum wage`_.

This is copied to the inside economy.
The inside economy is a separate encapsulation with its

- *own internal minimum wage*

which corresponds to `p=1` and is the unit of internal work (`W_h`, `h` refers to hour).

Work that turns out to be less valuable than the external `minimum wage`_ needs to be

- revalued or
- automated

Automation is in general important

- to increase the internal work value
- to keep the final product competitive and
- to produce profit to finance new projects

The *internal work value* also considers the tools needed to perform the work.
The person who needs a computer or car to do his work gets a work value that considers these tools.

Work shares constitute internal capital.

Work does not need to be measured in time.
Work can be measured by result, e.g.

- by products sold
- by customers acquired
- by members recruited
- ...

The work shares are recorded in (separate) internal units.
When pricing the product for the external market,
the internal work measures need to be considered
with temporary acceptable conversion factors to the outside price.

How and how precise work is recording needs to be agreed upon.
There should be an effort in the fair attribution of work,
but how much is up to the members.

Work shares can be

- donated
- inherited
- used as pledge for a loan,
  if accepted by a creditor
- basically also sold,
  but a price is probably hard to agree upon,
  since the actual value in the outside economy is unknown

.. _`share`:

:share:

**Work shares** document the ownership.
Here **share** always means work or contribution shares.

Work shares produce delayed income in an outside currency,
when the product of the work is sold.

Only work is considered that is **relevant** for current sale,

- either current work or
- work in the past

A more complex product needs organizational encapsulations, inner econs.
The output of more econs is used in a integrating econ.
Such a integrating econ has

- direct top level econs (integrators) and
- inner econs

as owners.

Ownership share consists of product ownership shares.
Product ownership shares of people (top nodes) are calculated from **product lattices**
considering inner nodes.
As contributions change over time, this calculation cannot be done in advance,
but it is done for every sold product.

The share is no single paper or datum, but

- calculated through an algorithm that uses
- data recorded throughout the product econ lattice

.. _`product`:

:product:

An econ lattice does not provide work as service for companies outside its lattice,
because work does not produce ownership in the outside economy.
Instead the econ lattice produces

- finished (technical) products
- helps in using the products
- maintains these products
- possibly recycles these products

The **product econ lattice** exists during the `product lifetime`_,
from development to recycling.

A new product has a new product econ lattice.

.. _`market`:

:market:

Market is a link to the outside economy.

A product

- has a market
- has a price in the market (more or less settled)

The product market produces income.
The product income is distributed according current product ownership.

.. _`openness`:

:openness:

Products are developed openly.

This also includes hardware.
Hardware should first be simulated,
but definitely also needs physical prototyping and testing effort.
This is considerable effort that should not need to be repeated.

Development is done by a central repo accessible to everybody.

Outside people can build on existing product development effort.
Their contributions makes them automatically owners of the product.

Construction and marketing is part of the product effort
and is recorded in the central repo,
whether done by the original product team or the newcomers.

Sales are forwarded according ownership,
which includes also development and testing effort.

If somebody constructs the product for himself without selling,
he has the construction cost only.
But this normally will be higher than buying the mass produced device.

If building the product is cheap, as for software,
then software is not the product,
but the know how to modify and improve the software.

Changes in the central repo might not be accepted in
by the existing developers, e.g. out of differing technical opinions.
Then the contributors can fork the product.
Forking must keep all the records of previous relevant work.
Income from sales are forwarded to owners on every fork.

Existing economic links cannot be forked as easily as a product.
Still, existing owners need to have a good reason not to accept a contribution,
because

- well motivated product forking might also drag along the economic links
- product forks

  - increase effort
  - decrease profit

Benefits of openness:

- People from the outside economy can join the/a product team easily

- If joining due to technical interest, this interest can be developed,
  because the invested time is payed

- Formation of a new product lattices by the community is easier

- Development becomes faster (less burocracy, less reinvention)

- The final products becomes more competitive (cheaper, better)

- Creating competing solutions allows to select the best solution

- Customers do get

  - more choice
  - better support by large community
  - can do their special adaptations and possibly contribute them
  - have no risk to lose the supplier because a company get bankrupt
  - can maintain the product for himself
    even if the community abandons it

The product repo contains

- a license
- technical instructions

explaining

- how contributions lead to ownership
- how sales is forwarded according ownership

and more generally how development is done

Therefore the license cannot be GPL,
but it should be compatible with GPL 
as existing open source software is the basis.

Software created along the product development,
but not directly linked to the product
should be released as GPL.
These efforts will not be considered in the product profit distribution,
but simplifies the product profit distribution,
because different products do not get linked by such common (software) infrastructure.

.. _`information`:

:information:

The members of an product team need to have access to information that allows them

- to do their work
- to check the fairness (access to the financial books)

The central product repo contains

- all the rules
- all the work share
- algorithms used to calculate ownership
- financial books (expenses, income, ...)

.. _`fairness`:

:fairness:

Prerequisite for fairness is information,
for plan, do, test or
using the idea of `separation of powers`_,
for legislative, executive and judicial power.

The rules constitute the *plan*.
A separate repo for the rules, makes them more reusable (this repo).
Everybody can change the rules and create a pull request.
If accepted by vote, the changed plan becomes the new plan.
This is (direct) *legislative* power.

Contributors are members and form the *executive* power.

There is the need to test the plan,
also regarding fairness.
This corresponds to the *judicial* power.

For a small econ or econ lattice
open information (work share, financial, algorithms)
allows everyone to check the fairness.

For a larger econ lattice
the extra effort motivates
a separate econ that does the fairness check.
As such an econ is not related to the product,
it motivates a separate econ lattice for fairness
checks on product teams (econ `audit`_).

.. _`money`:

:money:

The major costs for technical products are development.
If developers effort to wait for the revenue via sale of finished products,
there is not much money needed.

Before that money can come from

- loans
- donations

Money cannot be used to change ownership of an econ lattice directly.
It can be done indirectly, if someone is payed by a third party
in exchange of forwarding his work shares to that party.

To keep workers from engaging in such relations

- the prospective of bigger profit if not directly payed should help
- else regular loans to the worker granted by the product econ lattice and financed by external loans.

Loans don't change ownership.
The profit through ownership is higher than
the interest on loans. Also,
the interest on loans can be considered in the pricing of the product.

.. _`limited_liability`:

:limited liability:

There are differences of `limited liability`_ between jurisdictions,
so econ defines its own limited liability,
which should be compatible with major jurisdictions, though.

A limited liability econ lattice (`LLE`_) acquires an own `legal entity`_
in a jurisdiction, **per product lattice**.

Initial capital coming from those founding the `LLE`_
are loans to the `LLE`_.

Founding an `LLE`_ must not produce ownership.
Only subsequent working on the product produces ownership,
independent of whether

- founders or
- non-founders

.. _`financial_control`:

:financial control:

The owners have control over the financial channels (e.g. bank account),
but it is normally delegated to buyers and sellers,
which register the financial flows in the repo,
for everybody to check,
with additional check from specialized fairness checkers.

.. _`econ_value`:

:econ value:

The value of an `LLE`_ is

- the community
- the work shares of each owner (with associated potential profit)
- equipment, inventory, ...

There is no need to calculate the full value of an `LLE`_,
because it cannot be sold as a whole.
An interested buyer would have to contact every contributor
and agree on a price for his work shares separately.

The community around a product `LLE`_
can freely regroup in other product `LLE`_'s
also concurrently.
The community of one `LLE`_ cannot be bought without employing everybody,
but that would mean control from the employer,
which would reduce personal freedom and profit.
It is unlikely that the community would agree to that.

The value of the `LLE`_ is associated to the members.
The profit from it according the agreed function of *relevant* work at a time.
If a product gets modified some work might be replaced.
Then the according worker's share becomes smaller.

Ownership vanishes
if (past) contributions stop to be relevant for the currently sold product.

.. _`profit`:

:profit:

Profit is income - expenses of a period.

Expenses are only related to the product.
Investment in big machines not related exclusively to the product,
need to be handled by a separate `LLE`_.

Working tools like the computer or a car belong to the person (top econ).
They are considered in the internal work value.

*Work is not an expense*,
because the profit becomes the reward for the work.

Profit from the period transactions is attributed to owners according current ownership.
This capital attribution

- is a result of ownership and
- does not produce ownership change.

The attributed capital belongs to the according owner,
but can be kept in the `LLE`_ as loan to it
if owner and `LLE`_ agree to do so.

.. _`wages`:

:wages:

Work

- produces ownership and 
- does not produce immediate income.

Wages constitute regular payments to owners, currently contributing or not,
to allow them to use products of the outside economy already before revenue from sales of the econ.

The `LLE`_ corresponding to a econ lattice accepts ownership as pledge for loans.

In an econ lattice,
wages are loans of the `LLE`_ to the owners,
but are accounted for only when the econ period profit is attributed.
If the econ does not make profit, wages are registered to period loss of the econ,
i.e. the `LLE`_ takes the risk.

Increasing wages increases the risk of period loss for the econ.
Period loss means that no profits can be attributed,
rather additional loans need to be taken.

If no loans are granted the `LLE`_ cannot pay wages any more.
If furthermore external obligations cannot be satisfied, there is the danger of liquidation.

Wages are thus a compromise of the owners between

- risk of third party take-over of owners
- risk of diminished wages
- risk of loss of wages or `LLE`_

As profit, also risk must be distributed between owners proportional to ownership.
This means that wages, if any, must given to all owners proportional to ownership.

The owners decide together the amount of wages to pay and whether at all.

If wages are payed, there is a minimal wage for someone new at an econ,
which, having no ownership yet,
would otherwise not get a wage.
As wages are loans, this is not money for free.
But if the `LLE`_ does not make profit in the period,
the money is lost.
The extra risk is taken indirectly by the current owners.

.. _`loan`:

:loan:

Founders, non-founders, owners or non-owners can give loans to the `LLE`_.
The `LLE`_ can give loans to the owners (wages).
The interest varies, but is at least as high as inflation of outside economy.
Loans do not change ownership.
