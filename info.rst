.. _`infopurpose`:

:purpose:

Ideas from the `inequality`_ blog
are reorganized and extended using `pdt`_:

- `info`_: introduction and concepts for the context
- `plan`_: ideas and motivations from the `inequality`_ blog
- `do`_: concrete rules, processes and contracts
- `test`_: feedback mechanisms (monitoring and adaptation)

The focus is on technology.

Important points:

- All organization is *per product*
- Product profit on the market values the work and rewards the workers
- Only work on the product can create *ownership*
- All money flow during development are *loans*
- *No boss*, but democratic decision making

Todo
====

- Common technical standards of econ projects
  make it easier to contribute to different projects.

- Econ projects need a community that shares the same values
  and drives the projects.

- Econ projects need a common site
  that allows searching for projects with unassigned work.
