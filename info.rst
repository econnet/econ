.. _`infopurpose`:

:purpose:

Ideas from the `inequality`_ blog
are reorganized and extended using `pdt`_:

- `info`_: introduction and concepts for the context
- `plan`_: ideas and motivations from the `inequality`_ blog
- `do`_: concrete rules, processes and contracts
- `test`_: feedback mechanisms (monitoring and adaptation)

The focus is on technology.

Important points:

- All organization is *per product*
- Product profit on the market values the work and rewards the workers
- Only work on the product can create *ownership* on the product profit
- All money flow during development are *loans*
- *No boss*, but democratic decision making

Economy
=======

.. _`infoevolution`:

:evolution:

Economic supply and demand corresponds to
creation of and selection from a variable (information processing),
which makes economy comparable to other
`evolutionary systems`_.
Information per time corresponds to energy.
The variables depend on the system, therefore also the type of energy.

`Evolutionary systems`_ produce **encapsulations** to reduce energy consumption.
In the economy, encapsulations down to a person are considered.

.. _`infoeconomy`:

:economy:

In physics as in economy **work** is related to energy (satisfaction in economy).

The purpose of work is to satisfy the person's need.
Maximizing a person's freedom is equivalent to maximizing the person's capital.

A free society is the sum over individual freedom.
Maximizing the society's freedom is equivalent to well distributed capital, i.e.
minimizing inequality.

The purpose of economy is to

- maximize society's satisfaction
- with minimal work

Economy is pivoting around *products*

- creation of products (work)
- selection of products (satisfaction = profit)

Work needs to be linked to profit.
But in current economy there is a separate work market,
that is not linked to profit.

Furthermore

- too much competition
- too little cooperation

makes satisfaction more work than necessary.

.. _`infomoney`:

:money:

Money is the valuation (pricing) of work in the economy via products.

Valuation of work has a broad range.
The value of work (interaction) depends on

- who you interact with
- how you interact

Who with and how to maximize the personal work value?

- Who relates to fairness between people and to machines (automation)
- How relates to encapsulation, organizationally and by content

Direct interaction (service) has less choice on optimization.
A better work pricing is achieved via products.

Once priced, the resulting money is a promise of economy
based on all current products and services (`fiat money`_).

Stable money requires

- reliability and
- trust

.. _`infoinflation`:

The economy is not capable to keep its promise, because

- development of products continues independently (competition)
- humans limited capability to plan ahead

The result is inflation.

The dissipative loss of information makes development non-deterministic.
Nature itself is non-deterministic due to dissipation,
but also due to limited precision (quantum).

Inflation is not seen in the money figure.
Inflation is a change in the unit (currency) with respect to other units.

.. _`infointerest`:

People should strive to be as reliable as possible,
to be trustworthy economic partners.

Since society is not very reliable,
the money is invested in people (or goods)
that promise to be more reliable than the general economy.
This is encoded in an *interest rate*.

The interest rate should at least balances the inflation rate.

.. _`inforisk`:

There is a risk associated with every endeavour.
That is the reason of inflation.

Risk can be reduced with accurate planning.

There are physical limits of planning due to limited information.
It is not possible to foresee the effect of an ad,
but it can be measured afterward to change the strategy.

Established products are safer,
because the price and the market is known.
But new product are more profitable.
The profitability of a product can be inferred from the work it allows to save.
Promising products are those that reduce the interactions, the economy.

Planning and development better than the general economy
should reduce the risk below inflation.

.. _`infoinvestment`:

:investment:

Any investment in a promising and well planned product
gives a better `return of investment`_
than the general economy.

Work investment is best priced by the product.

Work can be given a current value in money
by comparing with prices of similar work,
if you want to include work in further calculations,
e.g. to calculate your `return of investment`_ on work.

.. _`infobookkeeping`:

:bookkeeping:

In bookkeeping money is regarded as conserved,
like conservation of energy.
Money flows from one account to another account (posting),
but does not get lost.
If money actually gets lost,
then there is a "loss" account,
to keep the books in order.
One tries to avoid loss, but sometimes it is unavoidable.

Income and expenses are in exchange of an asset of equivalent value,
which is also recorded to keep the total value unchanged.

For financial reporting required by government at the end of a financial period,
accounts need to be closed by postings balancing input and output.
The closing balance is transferred to an opening balance for the new period.

Bookkeeping hinges on pricing of assets.
Well established prices make bookkeeping more easily fit to reality.
Speculative assets may be priced by expectation, maximum or minimum,
or not priced at all,
depending on what is more favorable for taxation.

Only priced values need to be kept in standard bookkeeping.
Non-priced assets can be recorded separately
and priced later by reality.

Work should be priced by the product's success.
