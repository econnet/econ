A product is the pivot of interactions: with the code, between people, with a prototype, ...
Before the actual value of the product is known,
effort of interactions is meassured with a product-internal currency, the *tribute*.
Bookkeeping is important in order to match

- the share of effort with
- the share of actual but delayed value.

The bookkeeping must be within the same repository to link it with the artefacts.
