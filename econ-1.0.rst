*************
Econ Contract
*************

:Version: 1.0
:Author: Roland Puntaier

Summary
=======

The econ contract are *additional terms* (7) to GPL-3.0 at the end of this file.

The name *econ* stands for

- ECOnomic interaction Node: a node in the organizational lattice
- Economic CONtent: a node in the content lattice
- Economic/Ethical/"Employless" CONtribution/CONstruction of tech devices, because efficient and counteracting inequality

The econ contract is between `contributors`_ to the `product`_.

`product`_ refers to what is sold on the market.

`Repo`_ is the `product`_ repository contains this file.

The goal of the econ contract is to assure
that all profit from marketing the product
is distributed to the `contributors`_ of the product.

The `repo`_'s purpose is to hold
all information associated with the product

The `repo`_ contains also the information about

- who contributed
- how much and
- how the profit is accordingly distributed

When the `repo`_ is modified this information must be kept up-to-date.

Governance
==========

.. epigraph:: A society is not democratic unless in all interactions.

.. _`decon`:

Econ
----

Motivated by `pproduct`_.

The perspective to economy is from a person.
Econ is an **inversion** of the usual economic hierarchy:
An econ does not "own/employ" a person, but the person owns an econ.
The person is at the top and interactions are its econs.
I.e., econs belong to people working there.

Econs are a cohesions of interactions fitting to the `cohesion`_ of content.
A new econ is motivated by

- a sub-content
- demanding prolonged interaction between econs

Econs form a mathematical `lattice`_.
*Econ lattice* refers to all econs and their relations
with respect to one product.
The econ lattice

- produces a finished (technical) product
- maintains and improves the product
- helps in using the product

An econ corresponds to a node in a *econ lattice*.
The contributors correspond to the econ's intent.
*Intent* in `concept lattice`_ are the attributes,
but the English sense of purpose (to produce content) fits well.

The *bottom econ* stands for the product.
It cares to coordinate other econs
to make the product successful on the market.

Econ interaction is done via content.
An econ member is a content contributor.
A content item corresponds to a product part.

Content encapsulations map to organizational encapsulations: econs.

- product → bottom econ (coordination)
- product parts → inner econs
- elementary product part → top econ

An econ stays even if the contributing people (team) change.

With a `concept lattice`_ in mind,
these names are used for relations of econs

contributors
    nodes above.

econs
    nodes below.

partners
    Sideward; nodes linked via content

siblings
    Sideward, nodes linked via contributors


.. _`dcontributors`:

Contributors
------------

Motivated by `pchoice`_.

Contributors are defined by contributions of `relevant work`_ to the product,
from inception to production and marketing, technical and organizational.

Contributors need to document their contribution in the product `repo`_.

Contributors to the product are
the owners (of the profit) of the product.

Owner is replaced by **contributor**
to avoid confusion with existing legal definitions.

People choose to engage in econs because of

- common interest and/or
- prospect of profit when selling the product

By contributing (new) contributors commit

- to comply to the rules in this econ contract
- to accept further current practices defined in the `repo`_ (e.g. `tribute algorithm <#d1>`_),
  with influence proportional to `tributes <#tributes>`_ (`decide <#dp>`)

A new contributor (not `micro-contributor <#db>`_) needs to register 

- a bank account to allow profit distribution
- additional contact data is optional, because the `repo`_ is a communication channel

.. _`db`:

:db: organizational effort

There is organizational effort associated with the formation of an econ lattice.
People need to

- find each other
- get the same understanding of the econ process and values (functioning well together)
- understand the current `repo`_
- choose or agree on who works on which product part
- create communication channels (`repo`_, html sites, chat channels, ...)

The formation effort is recorded to the final product
e.g. by product initiators, coordinators and/or recruiters.

To integrate a contributor into the product development is effort.
Micro-contributors are those that contribute below this effort.
Micro-contributors are not registered contributors
and therefore not considered in the profit distribution.

.. _`dl`:

:dl: reliability

The contributors

- commit to the product
- plan the product
- work on the product
- finish the product
- own the product
- profit from the product

Finishing the product is essential to be able to interact with the market.
Becoming a contributor

- is an implicit *promise* to the other contributors
- to stick to the product until finished

Contributors concentrate on the product.
Money follows only, if a product is finished.

A dropout contributor still gets money,
if the product is finished,
but the risk of not getting finished is higher.

Reliability reduces effort to reorganize.
Reorganization effort is done by the bottom econ.
Not being reliable

- gives the bottom econ a bigger share of profit
- reduces the overall profit/work ratio

.. _`dprocess`:

Process
-------

Motivated by `pnoboss`_, `pfair`_.

.. _`do`:

:do: equality

In an econ lattice, no one has control over someone else.
There is **no boss**, neither in an econ, nor in the econ lattice.

Control may refer to controlling the product-related content.

Someone initiating or coordinating does not decide, but mediates an agreement.
The less coordination needed, the better.
The `repo`_ should contain all the information
to do without coordination.

.. _`dk`:

:dk: choice

The product to a large part determines the work that needs to be done.

Based on the existing plans in the `repo`_,
contributors or aspiring contributors *choose work*
from a list of unassigned work in the `repo`_.

If there is no unassigned work listed,
one can make a work proposal (e.g. according `pdt`_).

.. _`dp`:

:dp: decision

There are no predefined roles.

Decision making is based on the principle:

- Those decide who are most concerned.

If more are concerned, there needs to be a proposal.
The proposal is worked out by one person (e.g. according `pdt`_)
either because of

- personal interest/stake or
- expertise

Normally that person also executes or coordinates the according effort.

Decisions are democratic between those concerned,
either by direct or delegated vote.

The *vote weight* is proportional to `tributes <#dtributes>`_.

Compliance to contracts (this file, license) is not for vote, though.
Changes to contracts can only be done *unanimously*.
E.g. the contributors can unanimously end the econ contract
and convert tributes to stock and sell the `LE`_.

.. _`df`:

:df: fairness

Having access to all product information,
including `tributes <#dtributes>`_ and financial `LE`_ data,
all contributors can check fairness.

An additional `ombudsman`_

- actively checks practices against this contract
- handles reported fairness issues or
- mediates other conflicts

.. _`dlegal`:

Legal
=====

Motivated by `pproduct`_, `pnoemployment`_

The econ values are not specific to a government.
They need to be compatible (legal) with all involved governments.

The fact that the econ lattice consists of econs,
allows each econ to be in a different government.
The econ, natural person or legal person, cares to interact with its government.

.. _`d0`:

:d0: general partnership

Legally,
contributors implicitly form a `general partnership`_ under `common or civil law`_
(in German: `Gesellschaft bürgerlichen Rechts`_),
bound by this econ contract.

.. _`le`:

:le: legal entity

The bottom econ founds a company
already during development,
if money flow is involved during the development of the product,
else before marketing.

`legal entity`_ (LE) refers to the bottom econ as a company,
else *bottom econ* is used (which can still be a person or a group of people).

The `LE`_ cares about product-specific interaction

- with its government
- creditors
- contributors

.. _`dj`:

:dj: LE per product

The `LE`_ is per product.
All product versions have the same `LE`_.
A repo `fork <#ds>`_ must not change the `LE`_ data in the repo.

A new version of the product possibly has a changed econ lattice.

`LE`_ ownership is summarized over all versions.

Profit distribution is per version.
A version that is never sold does not produce profit.

.. _`dg`:

:dg: taxes

The major interest of a government is taxes.

- When selling the product,
  the `VAT`_ is added to the final product,
  if required by the government

- Taxing of the econ is according location of the econ.
  So profit taxation of a product
  spreads over more governments
  with one as a special case.

.. _`dw`:

:dw: cash

All product-related cash flow goes via the `LE`_,
to account them to the product according government requirements.

The contributors have control over the financial channels (e.g. bank account),
but it is delegated to the `LE`_,
which register the money flows in the repo,
for everybody to check,
with possible additional checks from specialized fairness checkers.

There can be more econs that concentrate on marketing (e.g. according region).
They register their effort in the repo.
The customer pays to the `LE`_ account.
The seller gets the profit proportional to the `tributes <#dtributes>`_.

.. _`dv`:

:dv: court

The government of the `LE`_'s residence
provides the jurisdiction for potential disputes.
That is not an interest of the government,
but rather of the contributors, creditors and product customers.

.. _`d9`:

:d9: no employment

The econ lattice **does not have employees**, because

| work on a product
| not producing ownership
| leads to a labor market and
| a separate labor market decouples work from its value
| i.e. the value of the product

In the econ contract

- everything is coupled to the product
- and so is work and its value

Not using employment is the major difference
between the econ lattice and traditional companies.
Profit sharing or advanced payments are usual practices.

The econs working on product parts
are separate entities (natural or legal) and
on purpose outside the control of the product `LE`_.
Accordingly they have their own responsibility to interact with their government,
whether the same or different.

Concentrating the effort of government interaction to saves effort is up to the econs,
as it is no product specific, since econs can contribute to more products.

.. _`dd`:

:dd: founding

Founding a `LE`_ must not produce `LE`_/product ownership.
Only subsequent product-relevant work produces `LE`_/product ownership.

When founding the `LE`_ the `articles of association`_ contain

- a description of the product the `LE`_ is for
- the econ contract
- the representatives
- how members are added or removed later (only for `cooperative`_)
- additional information as required by the government

.. _`di`:

:di: control

A `LE`_ is only interface (an address)

- for the government
- for the market

Contributors secure control over the `LE`_

- by this econ contract and possibly
- by registering as member to the `LE`_,
  if its `legal entity type`_
  gives control to the members by default (`cooperative`_, `joint-stock company`_)

A `joint-stock company`_ satisfies the econ values
if the `articles of association`_ assure that `tributes <#dtributes>`_ are the only "stock"

.. _`dy`:

:dy: limited liability

An initial `LE`_ cannot be a `limited liability`_ `LE`_,
unless the founders forward `liable capital`_.
`Liable capital`_ emphasize its purpose as risk capital without defining ownership.

There is also probably no need for `limited liability`_
before actually interacting with the outside economy.

It is better therefore to found a  `limited liability`_ `LE`_
only before selling the product,

- by conversion from an existing `LE`_
- by creating an additional production and marketing `LE`_ joining the product econ lattice
- by creating an `LE`_ only when actually producing and marketing

When the product development is finished

- most product owners are known by their contributions
- the `liable capital`_ can be raised by these contributors
- `liable capital`_ overlaps with outside economy's definition of `equity`_,
  but we keep the distinction by continuing to use `liable capital`_.

The `LE`_ takes the responsibility for the product according `limited liability`_.

.. _`dc`:

:dc: written

All product-related information and communication is in the product `repo <#dh>`_.

- in a **written** form
- with **URL**

to

- spread information
- link information
- allow recording of effort

Communication in other channels
are copied/recorded into the repo afterwards,
if `relevant <#drelevant>`_ for the product.

Meetings, if any,
are enjoyable parties or activities for team building,
normally not related and attributed to the product.

.. _`dproduct`:

Product
=======

Motivated by efficiency, `pproduct`_, `popen`_, `pchoice`

The product is a finished (tested, readily usable) item by which

- contributors interact with the
- the market (customers)

.. _`d8`:

:d8: open development

Information about the product is not the product.

The product `repo <#dh>`_ has open `access`_.

The repo and thus the information in the repo
can be used according the license.

.. _`da`:

:da: existing

The product does not need to be a new product type.
An existing product price and market is valuable for planning.
The new open development method

- can make a difference on the market
- can open new directions for a product type

If a product type has an econ repo already,
contribute to that repo, possibly also a new version,
instead of creating a new repo.

.. _`d5`:

:d5: conversion

The product is the output item to the outside economy.
There are also input items from the outside economy (commercial off-the-shelf, `cots`_).
Work refers only to the conversion of input items to the product.

Only product parts that are developed internally
require prolonged work and thus an econ.

`Cots`_ require work to select the right item and supplier,
recorded via a report,
but there is no need for a separate econ,
because it is not prolonged work.

.. _`d7`:

:d7: software byproducts

New software created along the product development,
but not directly linked to the product
is released as separate product with GPL license.

Effort spent on GPL software needed by the product
is accounted to the product.

This procedures produces more reusability and more open software,
which means less organizational overhead for future products.

.. _`de`:

:de: hardware spin-off

Hardware parts of a product device
that have a market outside the product,
should form a new separate product,
i.e. separate repo, separate `LE`_, separate econ lattice.
The product uses the spin-off product as `cots`_.

.. _`dx`:

:dx: pricing

The product is *not gratis*, but produces a profit,
which requires recording `tributes <#dtributes>`_ for fair distribution of profit.

The pricing needs to consider several aspects and all the data in the repo.
The product price is proposed by one person and internally `decided <#dp>`_.

A gratis product is normally

- a product with only micro-contributors created by a community (of users)
- a byproduct of work otherwise rewarded

Information, including software, should be gratis,

- because those using the information should be able to change it, if not applicable as provided
- because there is *no construction cost* (`variable cost`_) and so
  - everybody can construct for personal use and
  - there is no loss if someone else also uses it
- because using information is sometimes more effort than creating it

Experts

- get payed to consult pure users of the product
- so their contribution to the product is directly rewarded from the users 
  (no need to record `tributes <#dtributes>`_)


.. _`drepo`:

Repo
----

The product produces `cohesion`_ of content.
All product-related content is in one repo.

Different products have no relation
other than via shared contributors
or shared `cots`_ (loose coupling).

The repo is a communication channel.
All information must be provided
to allow contributors to act independently.
Also non-contributors must easily see,
where they can contribute.

The repo uses `git`_ as `version control system`_.

The original repo is stored in the cloud with `access <#d6>`_ via an URL.
Modifications (`forks <#ds>`_) do the same.

The product repo contains:

- governance (`LE`_ contact data, values, contributors, `work kinds <#dn>`_, ...)
- financing (expenses, income, `liabilities`_, ...)
- development (hardware, software, test, development docs, usage docs, license, ...)
- production (`SOP`_'s, `DMR`_, `DHF`_, ...)
- marketing

The repo links profit with work via content.
It records and provides information about

- work `tributes <#dtributes>`_
- profit

`Forks <#ds>`_ must keep this information up-to-date.

Folders that do not depend on product version
are kept in a separate "unversioned" git branch: e.g. financing and marketing.

An example layout could look like this::

  repo

.. _`d6`:

:d6: access

The registered *contributors* have access to the repo
It allows them

- to do their work (development and production)
- to check the fairness (effort, financing and marketing)
- interact (governance)

*Non-contributors* have access to the repo

- to allow them to choose to contribute
- to avoid repeating effort
- to keep `tributes <#dtributes>`_ together with content

Open information is to share effort.
The econ contract demands profit distribution proportional to `tributes <#dtributes>`_.

- `Forking <#ds>`_ does not lose the `tributes <#dtributes>`_ and thus 
- `Forking <#ds>`_ still leads to profit for the contributors via the `LE <#dj>`_.

Some information in the repo
can be reserved to contributors by `pgp`_-encryption.

.. _`ds`:

:ds: fork

Access to the original repo may not mean direct access,
because it would mean too much effort for the bottom econ
to build trust to too many contributors.

Access includes *repo forking* and creating pull requests to the original.
*Pull requests* are merged as is.
Modifications need to be done as a new pull request.

The original repo needs to react timely to pull requests,
to *avoid product forks*.

A product fork is a product version.
It is preferred to keep product versions as branches in the orginal repo.

All contributions promising to be `relevant <#drelevant>`_
get merged into the original repo at least after mediation.
Existing contributors provide/allow/grant `choice <#dk>`_ to contribute.

.. _`dwork`:

Work
====

Motivated by `pnoemployment`_, `pnostock`_.

.. _`d2`:

:d2: invaluable

The actual value of product-related work
is only determined by the success of the product on the market.
To stop inequality from growing, it is essential

- *not to value product-related work using an outside currency*

A separate labor market, decoupled from the produced value, cannot be a reference.

*Work* does not only refer to technical development of the product,
but to all aspects to make a finished product successful on the market.

.. _`drelevant`:

Relevant Work
-------------

Product contributions include all product-related activities
up to the shipping of the final product to the customer.

Only **relevant work** for the currently sold **product version** counts as contribution.

If new contributors take over,
their effort will matter for future product versions, if sold.
Previous contributors

- will still get their profit share on relevant work
- can still check for fairness

Work is measured by its result.

*Relevancy* requires work to be associated with product parts and thus econs.
When the part is replaced that work becomes irrelevant.
For `diversification`_ people should contribute to more parts.

Work that is not exclusively for the specific product is its own product,
that comes from the outside economy.

.. _`dtributes`:

Tributes
--------

The **econ contract** requires the `LE`_ to care to

- *attribute* to econs the work *contribution* to the product
- *distribute* profit proportionally

All these words contain "tribute".
Therefore the effort to provide the product is called tribute.

Tributes

- are a capital or energy per product
- define `LE`_ ownership

Tributes produce delayed income in an outside currency when the product is sold.
Until then tributes can still be

- inherited
- used as security for a loan (see `advances <#dadvances>`_)

Tributes are not for sale, else they would become like normal `stock`_.
Tributes get value in the outside economy only through selling the product.

.. _`dworkunit`:

Work Units
----------

The product involves different kinds of work.
Certain work needs more expertise than other.
When quantifying results internally,

- the kind of work has more weight
- than the contributor who does the work

.. _`dt`:

:dt: performance

Measuring the performance of a contributor is depreciative and biased,
as neither experience nor education nor exams
need to reflect in the result.
A less performant contributor will take longer,
i.e. automatically get less profit per time compared to others.
The quality of the result is checked,
therefore fast results of low quality will still take longer to reach accepted quality.

.. _`dn`:

:dn: work kinds

Every kind of work has its own result unit.

*Work kinds* units can be

- lines of a report (steps taken,...)

- lines of a plan (why, requirements, testing, ...)

- number of records per type (account journal, contributors recruited, customers acquired, ...)

- lines of code (described as much as possible with a language, general is preferred over `DSL`_)

To get to a profit distribution key,
the *work kind* units are internally valued against a standard work unit (**tribute** unit).
The *tribute* unit is described
based on an activity that is frequent for the product.

The tribute unit has no exchange rate to an outside currency.

.. _`d1`:

:d1: tribute algorithm

The `repo`_ contains an algorithm that
*automatically* calculates the contributor's tributes from the `repo`_.

In the product `repo`_ files are ordered by content,
but can be associated by *symbolic links* to

- kind of work
- contributor

to provide input for the algorithm.

Review/change on file(s) of other contributor
is considered by a report file
which is associated to the reviewer or bug fixer.

.. _`dr`:

:dr: precision

How and how precise work is recorded needs to be agreed upon.
There should be an effort in the fair attribution of work,
but how much is decided by the contributors by proposal and vote.
Micro-recording and micro-payments produce more effort than value
and thus produce deficit.
This is true for accounting in general.

.. _`dtools`:

Tools
-----

Tools have a market price.
They can therefore be accounted with that currency.

Product-specific tools are completely accounted to the product.

But to reduce the accounting effort,
cheap and obvious non-product-specific tools can be subsumed by either

- work kind or
- contributor

More expensive non-product-specific tools not exclusively for the product,
are outsourced to a separate entity.
E.g. a car can be considered by the renting cost,
even if it is owned by the contributor
when using it for a product-specific work.

.. _`dfinancing`:

Financing
=========

Motivated by `pnostock`_ and `pprofit`_.

The major costs for technical products are development.
If developers can afford to wait for the revenue via sale of the finished product,
there is not much money needed.

Smaller expenses can be financed from the contributors,
but through the `LE`_ (`dw`_).

Financing through `stock`_ cannot be used,
because `LE`_ ownership

- is defined by work (`tributes <#dtributes>`_)
- not via capital

Money can also not change `LE`_ ownership indirectly.
A contributor can be payed to produce tributes,
but the tributes cannot be forwarded to the paying party (see `tributes <#dtributes>`_).
The pay therefore is either donation or debt (e.g. `advances <#dadvances>`_).

.. _`du`:

:du: debt

Before actual income, the money can come from

- debt e.g. bonds (`liabilities`_)
- donations

Money *cannot* be used to change ownership of the `LE`_.
Bonds don't change ownership.
The profit through ownership is higher than
the interest on bonds. Also,
the interest on bonds can be considered in the product price.

.. _`d3`:

:d3: risk

Risk associated with the product is considered via interest rate on debt.

Contributors also risk their work investment.

Quantifying risk with a `risk assessment`_ helps to decide

- whether to do the product at all
- and what interest rate to pay on debt (`bond rating`_, creditworthiness)

Good prospective on earnings must not increase interest rate on debt, but lower it.
Interest rate is for risk and to some extend honoring trust, but not for profit sharing.

.. _`dz`:

:dz: profit

profit = income - expenses within a financial period.

Expenses are only those related to the product.
Expenses need to be handled by the `LE`_ (`dw`_).

*Work is not an expense*,
because the profit becomes the reward for the work.

Profit from the product sales of the period
is attributed to contributors
separate for every *product version* (`tributes <#dtributes>`_)

The profit

- is buffered in the `LE`_ (`retained earnings`_)
- is forwarded to the owners according tributes
- can be reinvested as `bonds`_

.. _`dadvances`:

Advances
--------

Work profit is delayed until sale.

Profit advances are *loans* of the `LE`_ to contributors,
to allow them to use products of the outside economy
already before revenue from sales of the product.

Advances are only needed if there is no profit yet.

Advances are secured by contribution

- either done already
- or promised

A contributor asking or accepting an advance for a *promised contribution*
is obliged to finish the promised contribution
if unable to pay back the advances.

Finished work contributions constitute `tributes <#dtributes>`_,
which have an internal value (if staying `relevant <#drelevant>`_),
and can be used as internal security for advances.

Advances must be payed back to the `LE`_
if the product does never make a profit (e.g. because not completed).
If not recoverable as cash,
work to produce product profit can be legally enforced (complete product, market product, ...).

The `LE`_ raises advances by donations and `bonds`_.
If the `LE`_ gets bankrupt, `bonds`_ might be lost.
The risk is

                        GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE
                           Version 3, 29 June 2007

     Copyright (C) 2007 Free Software Foundation, Inc. <https://fsf.org/>
     Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies
     of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.

                                Preamble

      The GNU General Public License is a free, copyleft license for
    software and other kinds of works.

      The licenses for most software and other practical works are designed
    to take away your freedom to share and change the works.  By contrast,
    the GNU General Public License is intended to guarantee your freedom to
    share and change all versions of a program--to make sure it remains free
    software for all its users.  We, the Free Software Foundation, use the
    GNU General Public License for most of our software; it applies also to
    any other work released this way by its authors.  You can apply it to
    your programs, too.

      When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not
    price.  Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you
    have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for
    them if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it if you
    want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it in new
    free programs, and that you know you can do these things.

      To protect your rights, we need to prevent others from denying you
    these rights or asking you to surrender the rights.  Therefore, you have
    certain responsibilities if you distribute copies of the software, or if
    you modify it: responsibilities to respect the freedom of others.

      For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether
    gratis or for a fee, you must pass on to the recipients the same
    freedoms that you received.  You must make sure that they, too, receive
    or can get the source code.  And you must show them these terms so they
    know their rights.

      Developers that use the GNU GPL protect your rights with two steps:
    (1) assert copyright on the software, and (2) offer you this License
    giving you legal permission to copy, distribute and/or modify it.

      For the developers' and authors' protection, the GPL clearly explains
    that there is no warranty for this free software.  For both users' and
    authors' sake, the GPL requires that modified versions be marked as
    changed, so that their problems will not be attributed erroneously to
    authors of previous versions.

      Some devices are designed to deny users access to install or run
    modified versions of the software inside them, although the manufacturer
    can do so.  This is fundamentally incompatible with the aim of
    protecting users' freedom to change the software.  The systematic
    pattern of such abuse occurs in the area of products for individuals to
    use, which is precisely where it is most unacceptable.  Therefore, we
    have designed this version of the GPL to prohibit the practice for those
    products.  If such problems arise substantially in other domains, we
    stand ready to extend this provision to those domains in future versions
    of the GPL, as needed to protect the freedom of users.

      Finally, every program is threatened constantly by software patents.
    States should not allow patents to restrict development and use of
    software on general-purpose computers, but in those that do, we wish to
    avoid the special danger that patents applied to a free program could
    make it effectively proprietary.  To prevent this, the GPL assures that
    patents cannot be used to render the program non-free.

      The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and
    modification follow.

                           TERMS AND CONDITIONS

      0. Definitions.

      "This License" refers to version 3 of the GNU General Public License.

      "Copyright" also means copyright-like laws that apply to other kinds of
    works, such as semiconductor masks.

      "The Program" refers to any copyrightable work licensed under this
    License.  Each licensee is addressed as "you".  "Licensees" and
    "recipients" may be individuals or organizations.

      To "modify" a work means to copy from or adapt all or part of the work
    in a fashion requiring copyright permission, other than the making of an
    exact copy.  The resulting work is called a "modified version" of the
    earlier work or a work "based on" the earlier work.

      A "covered work" means either the unmodified Program or a work based
    on the Program.

      To "propagate" a work means to do anything with it that, without
    permission, would make you directly or secondarily liable for
    infringement under applicable copyright law, except executing it on a
    computer or modifying a private copy.  Propagation includes copying,
    distribution (with or without modification), making available to the
    public, and in some countries other activities as well.

      To "convey" a work means any kind of propagation that enables other
    parties to make or receive copies.  Mere interaction with a user through
    a computer network, with no transfer of a copy, is not conveying.

      An interactive user interface displays "Appropriate Legal Notices"
    to the extent that it includes a convenient and prominently visible
    feature that (1) displays an appropriate copyright notice, and (2)
    tells the user that there is no warranty for the work (except to the
    extent that warranties are provided), that licensees may convey the
    work under this License, and how to view a copy of this License.  If
    the interface presents a list of user commands or options, such as a
    menu, a prominent item in the list meets this criterion.

      1. Source Code.

      The "source code" for a work means the preferred form of the work
    for making modifications to it.  "Object code" means any non-source
    form of a work.

      A "Standard Interface" means an interface that either is an official
    standard defined by a recognized standards body, or, in the case of
    interfaces specified for a particular programming language, one that
    is widely used among developers working in that language.

      The "System Libraries" of an executable work include anything, other
    than the work as a whole, that (a) is included in the normal form of
    packaging a Major Component, but which is not part of that Major
    Component, and (b) serves only to enable use of the work with that
    Major Component, or to implement a Standard Interface for which an
    implementation is available to the public in source code form.  A
    "Major Component", in this context, means a major essential component
    (kernel, window system, and so on) of the specific operating system
    (if any) on which the executable work runs, or a compiler used to
    produce the work, or an object code interpreter used to run it.

      The "Corresponding Source" for a work in object code form means all
    the source code needed to generate, install, and (for an executable
    work) run the object code and to modify the work, including scripts to
    control those activities.  However, it does not include the work's
    System Libraries, or general-purpose tools or generally available free
    programs which are used unmodified in performing those activities but
    which are not part of the work.  For example, Corresponding Source
    includes interface definition files associated with source files for
    the work, and the source code for shared libraries and dynamically
    linked subprograms that the work is specifically designed to require,
    such as by intimate data communication or control flow between those
    subprograms and other parts of the work.

      The Corresponding Source need not include anything that users
    can regenerate automatically from other parts of the Corresponding
    Source.

      The Corresponding Source for a work in source code form is that
    same work.

      2. Basic Permissions.

      All rights granted under this License are granted for the term of
    copyright on the Program, and are irrevocable provided the stated
    conditions are met.  This License explicitly affirms your unlimited
    permission to run the unmodified Program.  The output from running a
    covered work is covered by this License only if the output, given its
    content, constitutes a covered work.  This License acknowledges your
    rights of fair use or other equivalent, as provided by copyright law.

      You may make, run and propagate covered works that you do not
    convey, without conditions so long as your license otherwise remains
    in force.  You may convey covered works to others for the sole purpose
    of having them make modifications exclusively for you, or provide you
    with facilities for running those works, provided that you comply with
    the terms of this License in conveying all material for which you do
    not control copyright.  Those thus making or running the covered works
    for you must do so exclusively on your behalf, under your direction
    and control, on terms that prohibit them from making any copies of
    your copyrighted material outside their relationship with you.

      Conveying under any other circumstances is permitted solely under
    the conditions stated below.  Sublicensing is not allowed; section 10
    makes it unnecessary.

      3. Protecting Users' Legal Rights From Anti-Circumvention Law.

      No covered work shall be deemed part of an effective technological
    measure under any applicable law fulfilling obligations under article
    11 of the WIPO copyright treaty adopted on 20 December 1996, or
    similar laws prohibiting or restricting circumvention of such
    measures.

      When you convey a covered work, you waive any legal power to forbid
    circumvention of technological measures to the extent such circumvention
    is effected by exercising rights under this License with respect to
    the covered work, and you disclaim any intention to limit operation or
    modification of the work as a means of enforcing, against the work's
    users, your or third parties' legal rights to forbid circumvention of
    technological measures.

      4. Conveying Verbatim Copies.

      You may convey verbatim copies of the Program's source code as you
    receive it, in any medium, provided that you conspicuously and
    appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate copyright notice;
    keep intact all notices stating that this License and any
    non-permissive terms added in accord with section 7 apply to the code;
    keep intact all notices of the absence of any warranty; and give all
    recipients a copy of this License along with the Program.

      You may charge any price or no price for each copy that you convey,
    and you may offer support or warranty protection for a fee.

      5. Conveying Modified Source Versions.

      You may convey a work based on the Program, or the modifications to
    produce it from the Program, in the form of source code under the
    terms of section 4, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:

        a) The work must carry prominent notices stating that you modified
        it, and giving a relevant date.

        b) The work must carry prominent notices stating that it is
        released under this License and any conditions added under section
        7.  This requirement modifies the requirement in section 4 to
        "keep intact all notices".

        c) You must license the entire work, as a whole, under this
        License to anyone who comes into possession of a copy.  This
        License will therefore apply, along with any applicable section 7
        additional terms, to the whole of the work, and all its parts,
        regardless of how they are packaged.  This License gives no
        permission to license the work in any other way, but it does not
        invalidate such permission if you have separately received it.

        d) If the work has interactive user interfaces, each must display
        Appropriate Legal Notices; however, if the Program has interactive
        interfaces that do not display Appropriate Legal Notices, your
        work need not make them do so.

      A compilation of a covered work with other separate and independent
    works, which are not by their nature extensions of the covered work,
    and which are not combined with it such as to form a larger program,
    in or on a volume of a storage or distribution medium, is called an
    "aggregate" if the compilation and its resulting copyright are not
    used to limit the access or legal rights of the compilation's users
    beyond what the individual works permit.  Inclusion of a covered work
    in an aggregate does not cause this License to apply to the other
    parts of the aggregate.

      6. Conveying Non-Source Forms.

      You may convey a covered work in object code form under the terms
    of sections 4 and 5, provided that you also convey the
    machine-readable Corresponding Source under the terms of this License,
    in one of these ways:

        a) Convey the object code in, or embodied in, a physical product
        (including a physical distribution medium), accompanied by the
        Corresponding Source fixed on a durable physical medium
        customarily used for software interchange.

        b) Convey the object code in, or embodied in, a physical product
        (including a physical distribution medium), accompanied by a
        written offer, valid for at least three years and valid for as
        long as you offer spare parts or customer support for that product
        model, to give anyone who possesses the object code either (1) a
        copy of the Corresponding Source for all the software in the
        product that is covered by this License, on a durable physical
        medium customarily used for software interchange, for a price no
        more than your reasonable cost of physically performing this
        conveying of source, or (2) access to copy the
        Corresponding Source from a network server at no charge.

        c) Convey individual copies of the object code with a copy of the
        written offer to provide the Corresponding Source.  This
        alternative is allowed only occasionally and noncommercially, and
        only if you received the object code with such an offer, in accord
        with subsection 6b.

        d) Convey the object code by offering access from a designated
        place (gratis or for a charge), and offer equivalent access to the
        Corresponding Source in the same way through the same place at no
        further charge.  You need not require recipients to copy the
        Corresponding Source along with the object code.  If the place to
        copy the object code is a network server, the Corresponding Source
        may be on a different server (operated by you or a third party)
        that supports equivalent copying facilities, provided you maintain
        clear directions next to the object code saying where to find the
        Corresponding Source.  Regardless of what server hosts the
        Corresponding Source, you remain obligated to ensure that it is
        available for as long as needed to satisfy these requirements.

        e) Convey the object code using peer-to-peer transmission, provided
        you inform other peers where the object code and Corresponding
        Source of the work are being offered to the general public at no
        charge under subsection 6d.

      A separable portion of the object code, whose source code is excluded
    from the Corresponding Source as a System Library, need not be
    included in conveying the object code work.

      A "User Product" is either (1) a "consumer product", which means any
    tangible personal property which is normally used for personal, family,
    or household purposes, or (2) anything designed or sold for incorporation
    into a dwelling.  In determining whether a product is a consumer product,
    doubtful cases shall be resolved in favor of coverage.  For a particular
    product received by a particular user, "normally used" refers to a
    typical or common use of that class of product, regardless of the status
    of the particular user or of the way in which the particular user
    actually uses, or expects or is expected to use, the product.  A product
    is a consumer product regardless of whether the product has substantial
    commercial, industrial or non-consumer uses, unless such uses represent
    the only significant mode of use of the product.

      "Installation Information" for a User Product means any methods,
    procedures, authorization keys, or other information required to install
    and execute modified versions of a covered work in that User Product from
    a modified version of its Corresponding Source.  The information must
    suffice to ensure that the continued functioning of the modified object
    code is in no case prevented or interfered with solely because
    modification has been made.

      If you convey an object code work under this section in, or with, or
    specifically for use in, a User Product, and the conveying occurs as
    part of a transaction in which the right of possession and use of the
    User Product is transferred to the recipient in perpetuity or for a
    fixed term (regardless of how the transaction is characterized), the
    Corresponding Source conveyed under this section must be accompanied
    by the Installation Information.  But this requirement does not apply
    if neither you nor any third party retains the ability to install
    modified object code on the User Product (for example, the work has
    been installed in ROM).

      The requirement to provide Installation Information does not include a
    requirement to continue to provide support service, warranty, or updates
    for a work that has been modified or installed by the recipient, or for
    the User Product in which it has been modified or installed.  Access to a
    network may be denied when the modification itself materially and
    adversely affects the operation of the network or violates the rules and
    protocols for communication across the network.

      Corresponding Source conveyed, and Installation Information provided,
    in accord with this section must be in a format that is publicly
    documented (and with an implementation available to the public in
    source code form), and must require no special password or key for
    unpacking, reading or copying.

      7. Additional Terms.

      "Additional permissions" are terms that supplement the terms of this
    License by making exceptions from one or more of its conditions.
    Additional permissions that are applicable to the entire Program shall
    be treated as though they were included in this License, to the extent
    that they are valid under applicable law.  If additional permissions
    apply only to part of the Program, that part may be used separately
    under those permissions, but the entire Program remains governed by
    this License without regard to the additional permissions.

      When you convey a copy of a covered work, you may at your option
    remove any additional permissions from that copy, or from any part of
    it.  (Additional permissions may be written to require their own
    removal in certain cases when you modify the work.)  You may place
    additional permissions on material, added by you to a covered work,
    for which you have or can give appropriate copyright permission.

      Notwithstanding any other provision of this License, for material you
    add to a covered work, you may (if authorized by the copyright holders of
    that material) supplement the terms of this License with terms:

        a) Disclaiming warranty or limiting liability differently from the
        terms of sections 15 and 16 of this License; or

        b) Requiring preservation of specified reasonable legal notices or
        author attributions in that material or in the Appropriate Legal
        Notices displayed by works containing it; or

        c) Prohibiting misrepresentation of the origin of that material, or
        requiring that modified versions of such material be marked in
        reasonable ways as different from the original version; or

        d) Limiting the use for publicity purposes of names of licensors or
        authors of the material; or

        e) Declining to grant rights under trademark law for use of some
        trade names, trademarks, or service marks; or

        f) Requiring indemnification of licensors and authors of that
        material by anyone who conveys the material (or modified versions of
        it) with contractual assumptions of liability to the recipient, for
        any liability that these contractual assumptions directly impose on
        those licensors and authors.

      All other non-permissive additional terms are considered "further
    restrictions" within the meaning of section 10.  If the Program as you
    received it, or any part of it, contains a notice stating that it is
    governed by this License along with a term that is a further
    restriction, you may remove that term.  If a license document contains
    a further restriction but permits relicensing or conveying under this
    License, you may add to a covered work material governed by the terms
    of that license document, provided that the further restriction does
    not survive such relicensing or conveying.

      If you add terms to a covered work in accord with this section, you
    must place, in the relevant source files, a statement of the
    additional terms that apply to those files, or a notice indicating
    where to find the applicable terms.

      Additional terms, permissive or non-permissive, may be stated in the
    form of a separately written license, or stated as exceptions;
    the above requirements apply either way.

      8. Termination.

      You may not propagate or modify a covered work except as expressly
    provided under this License.  Any attempt otherwise to propagate or
    modify it is void, and will automatically terminate your rights under
    this License (including any patent licenses granted under the third
    paragraph of section 11).

      However, if you cease all violation of this License, then your
    license from a particular copyright holder is reinstated (a)
    provisionally, unless and until the copyright holder explicitly and
    finally terminates your license, and (b) permanently, if the copyright
    holder fails to notify you of the violation by some reasonable means
    prior to 60 days after the cessation.

      Moreover, your license from a particular copyright holder is
    reinstated permanently if the copyright holder notifies you of the
    violation by some reasonable means, this is the first time you have
    received notice of violation of this License (for any work) from that
    copyright holder, and you cure the violation prior to 30 days after
    your receipt of the notice.

      Termination of your rights under this section does not terminate the
    licenses of parties who have received copies or rights from you under
    this License.  If your rights have been terminated and not permanently
    reinstated, you do not qualify to receive new licenses for the same
    material under section 10.

      9. Acceptance Not Required for Having Copies.

      You are not required to accept this License in order to receive or
    run a copy of the Program.  Ancillary propagation of a covered work
    occurring solely as a consequence of using peer-to-peer transmission
    to receive a copy likewise does not require acceptance.  However,
    nothing other than this License grants you permission to propagate or
    modify any covered work.  These actions infringe copyright if you do
    not accept this License.  Therefore, by modifying or propagating a
    covered work, you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so.

      10. Automatic Licensing of Downstream Recipients.

      Each time you convey a covered work, the recipient automatically
    receives a license from the original licensors, to run, modify and
    propagate that work, subject to this License.  You are not responsible
    for enforcing compliance by third parties with this License.

      An "entity transaction" is a transaction transferring control of an
    organization, or substantially all assets of one, or subdividing an
    organization, or merging organizations.  If propagation of a covered
    work results from an entity transaction, each party to that
    transaction who receives a copy of the work also receives whatever
    licenses to the work the party's predecessor in interest had or could
    give under the previous paragraph, plus a right to possession of the
    Corresponding Source of the work from the predecessor in interest, if
    the predecessor has it or can get it with reasonable efforts.

      You may not impose any further restrictions on the exercise of the
    rights granted or affirmed under this License.  For example, you may
    not impose a license fee, royalty, or other charge for exercise of
    rights granted under this License, and you may not initiate litigation
    (including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that
    any patent claim is infringed by making, using, selling, offering for
    sale, or importing the Program or any portion of it.

      11. Patents.

      A "contributor" is a copyright holder who authorizes use under this
    License of the Program or a work on which the Program is based.  The
    work thus licensed is called the contributor's "contributor version".

      A contributor's "essential patent claims" are all patent claims
    owned or controlled by the contributor, whether already acquired or
    hereafter acquired, that would be infringed by some manner, permitted
    by this License, of making, using, or selling its contributor version,
    but do not include claims that would be infringed only as a
    consequence of further modification of the contributor version.  For
    purposes of this definition, "control" includes the right to grant
    patent sublicenses in a manner consistent with the requirements of
    this License.

      Each contributor grants you a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free
    patent license under the contributor's essential patent claims, to
    make, use, sell, offer for sale, import and otherwise run, modify and
    propagate the contents of its contributor version.

      In the following three paragraphs, a "patent license" is any express
    agreement or commitment, however denominated, not to enforce a patent
    (such as an express permission to practice a patent or covenant not to
    sue for patent infringement).  To "grant" such a patent license to a
    party means to make such an agreement or commitment not to enforce a
    patent against the party.

      If you convey a covered work, knowingly relying on a patent license,
    and the Corresponding Source of the work is not available for anyone
    to copy, free of charge and under the terms of this License, through a
    publicly available network server or other readily accessible means,
    then you must either (1) cause the Corresponding Source to be so
    available, or (2) arrange to deprive yourself of the benefit of the
    patent license for this particular work, or (3) arrange, in a manner
    consistent with the requirements of this License, to extend the patent
    license to downstream recipients.  "Knowingly relying" means you have
    actual knowledge that, but for the patent license, your conveying the
    covered work in a country, or your recipient's use of the covered work
    in a country, would infringe one or more identifiable patents in that
    country that you have reason to believe are valid.

      If, pursuant to or in connection with a single transaction or
    arrangement, you convey, or propagate by procuring conveyance of, a
    covered work, and grant a patent license to some of the parties
    receiving the covered work authorizing them to use, propagate, modify
    or convey a specific copy of the covered work, then the patent license
    you grant is automatically extended to all recipients of the covered
    work and works based on it.

      A patent license is "discriminatory" if it does not include within
    the scope of its coverage, prohibits the exercise of, or is
    conditioned on the non-exercise of one or more of the rights that are
    specifically granted under this License.  You may not convey a covered
    work if you are a party to an arrangement with a third party that is
    in the business of distributing software, under which you make payment
    to the third party based on the extent of your activity of conveying
    the work, and under which the third party grants, to any of the
    parties who would receive the covered work from you, a discriminatory
    patent license (a) in connection with copies of the covered work
    conveyed by you (or copies made from those copies), or (b) primarily
    for and in connection with specific products or compilations that
    contain the covered work, unless you entered into that arrangement,
    or that patent license was granted, prior to 28 March 2007.

      Nothing in this License shall be construed as excluding or limiting
    any implied license or other defenses to infringement that may
    otherwise be available to you under applicable patent law.

      12. No Surrender of Others' Freedom.

      If conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or
    otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not
    excuse you from the conditions of this License.  If you cannot convey a
    covered work so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this
    License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you may
    not convey it at all.  For example, if you agree to terms that obligate you
    to collect a royalty for further conveying from those to whom you convey
    the Program, the only way you could satisfy both those terms and this
    License would be to refrain entirely from conveying the Program.

      13. Use with the GNU Affero General Public License.

      Notwithstanding any other provision of this License, you have
    permission to link or combine any covered work with a work licensed
    under version 3 of the GNU Affero General Public License into a single
    combined work, and to convey the resulting work.  The terms of this
    License will continue to apply to the part which is the covered work,
    but the special requirements of the GNU Affero General Public License,
    section 13, concerning interaction through a network will apply to the
    combination as such.

      14. Revised Versions of this License.

      The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions of
    the GNU General Public License from time to time.  Such new versions will
    be similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to
    address new problems or concerns.

      Each version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the
    Program specifies that a certain numbered version of the GNU General
    Public License "or any later version" applies to it, you have the
    option of following the terms and conditions either of that numbered
    version or of any later version published by the Free Software
    Foundation.  If the Program does not specify a version number of the
    GNU General Public License, you may choose any version ever published
    by the Free Software Foundation.

      If the Program specifies that a proxy can decide which future
    versions of the GNU General Public License can be used, that proxy's
    public statement of acceptance of a version permanently authorizes you
    to choose that version for the Program.

      Later license versions may give you additional or different
    permissions.  However, no additional obligations are imposed on any
    author or copyright holder as a result of your choosing to follow a
    later version.

      15. Disclaimer of Warranty.

      THERE IS NO WARRANTY FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY
    APPLICABLE LAW.  EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT
    HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE PROGRAM "AS IS" WITHOUT WARRANTY
    OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO,
    THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR
    PURPOSE.  THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM
    IS WITH YOU.  SHOULD THE PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF
    ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.

      16. Limitation of Liability.

      IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING
    WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MODIFIES AND/OR CONVEYS
    THE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY
    GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE
    USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF
    DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD
    PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER PROGRAMS),
    EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF
    SUCH DAMAGES.

      17. Interpretation of Sections 15 and 16.

      If the disclaimer of warranty and limitation of liability provided
    above cannot be given local legal effect according to their terms,
    reviewing courts shall apply local law that most closely approximates
    an absolute waiver of all civil liability in connection with the
    Program, unless a warranty or assumption of liability accompanies a
    copy of the Program in return for a fee.

                         END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS

                How to Apply These Terms to Your New Programs

      If you develop a new program, and you want it to be of the greatest
    possible use to the public, the best way to achieve this is to make it
    free software which everyone can redistribute and change under these terms.

      To do so, attach the following notices to the program.  It is safest
    to attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively
    state the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least
    the "copyright" line and a pointer to where the full notice is found.

        <one line to give the program's name and a brief idea of what it does.>
        Copyright (C) <year>  <name of author>

        This program is free software: you can redistribute it and/or modify
        it under the terms of the GNU General Public License as published by
        the Free Software Foundation, either version 3 of the License, or
        (at your option) any later version.

        This program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,
        but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of
        MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  See the
        GNU General Public License for more details.

        You should have received a copy of the GNU General Public License
        along with this program.  If not, see <https://www.gnu.org/licenses/>.

    Also add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper mail.

      If the program does terminal interaction, make it output a short
    notice like this when it starts in an interactive mode:

        <program>  Copyright (C) <year>  <name of author>
        This program comes with ABSOLUTELY NO WARRANTY; for details type `show w'.
        This is free software, and you are welcome to redistribute it
        under certain conditions; type `show c' for details.

    The hypothetical commands `show w' and `show c' should show the appropriate
    parts of the General Public License.  Of course, your program's commands
    might be different; for a GUI interface, you would use an "about box".

      You should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or school,
    if any, to sign a "copyright disclaimer" for the program, if necessary.
    For more information on this, and how to apply and follow the GNU GPL, see
    <https://www.gnu.org/licenses/>.

      The GNU General Public License does not permit incorporating your program
    into proprietary programs.  If your program is a subroutine library, you
    may consider it more useful to permit linking proprietary applications with
    the library.  If this is what you want to do, use the GNU Lesser General
    Public License instead of this License.  But first, please read
    <https://www.gnu.org/licenses/why-not-lgpl.html>.
