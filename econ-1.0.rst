*************
Econ Contract
*************

:Version: 1.0

Summary
=======

This contract is between the `contributors`_
to the `product`_ repository (`repo <#dh>`_)
that contains this file.

`product`_ refers to a technical device.

The goal of the econ contract is to assure
that all profit from marketing the product
is distributed to the `contributors`_ of the product.

The repo's purpose is to hold
all information associated with the product
from inception to marketing, technical and organizational.

The repo contains also the information about

- who contributed
- how much and
- how the profit must be accordingly distributed

When the repo is modified this information must be kept up-to-date.

This file also contains some technical proposals to meet the values.
These can be modified in a specific repo,
if not reducing the contributor's overall freedom, control and profit.

Governance
==========

.. epigraph:: A society is not democratic unless in all interactions.

.. _`decon`:

Econ
----

Motivated by `pproduct`_.

The name *econ* stands for

- to an organizational topology (econ = ECOnomic interaction Node)
- a map of the content topology (econ = Economic CONtent)
- a contributor (econ = Economic CONtributor)

Econ also stands for the *ethical values* in this repo.

The perspective to economy is from a person.
Econ is an **inversion** of the usual economic hierarchy:
An econ does not "own/employ" a person, but the person owns an econ.
The person is at the top and interactions are its econs,
i.e. econs belong to people working there.

Econs are a cohesions of interactions fitting to the `cohesion`_ of content.
A new econ is

- a sub-content
- demanding prolonged interaction between econs

Econs form a mathematical `lattice`_.
*Econ lattice* refers to all econs and their relations,
with respect to one product.
The econ lattice

- produces a finished (technical) product
- maintains and improves the product
- helps in using the product

An econ corresponds to a node in a *econ lattice*.
The contributors correspond to the econ's intent.
*Intent* in `concept lattice`_ are the attributes,
but the English sense of purpose to produce content fits well.

The *bottom econ* stands for the product.
It cares to coordinate other econs 
to make the product successful on the market.

Econ interaction is done via content.
An econ member is a content contributor.
A content item corresponds to a product part.

Content encapsulations map to organizational encapsulations: econs.

- product → bottom econ (coordination)
- product parts → inner econs
- elementary product part → top econ

An econ stays even if the contributing people (team) change.

With a `concept lattice`_ in mind,
these names are used for relations of econs

contributors
    nodes above.

econs
    nodes below.

partners
    Sideward; nodes linked via content

siblings
    Sideward, nodes linked via contributors


.. _`dcontributors`:

Contributors
------------

Motivated by `powner`_.

**Contributors** to the product are
the owners (of the profit) of the product.

Owner is replaced by **contributor**
to avoid conflict with existing legal definitions.

People choose to engage in econs because of

- common interest and/or
- prospect of profit when selling the product

By contributing the contributors commit

- to comply to the rules in this econ contract
- to accept further current practices defined in the repo (e.g. `tribute algorithm <#d1>`_)

A new contributor (not micro-contributor) needs to register 

- a bank account to allow profit distribution
- additional contact data is optional, because the repo is a communication channel

.. _`db`:

:db: organization

There is organizational effort associated with the formation of an econ lattice.
People need to

- find each other
- get the same understanding of the econ process and values (functioning well together)
- choose or agree on who works on which product part
- create communication channels (repo, html sites, chat channels, ...)

The formation effort is recorded to the final product
e.g. by product initiators, coordinators and/or recruiters.

To integrate a contributor into the product development is effort.
Micro-contributors are those that contribute below this effort.
Micro-contributors are not registered contributors
and therefore not considered in the profit distribution.

A product with only micro-contributors is normally a byproduct of a community
who creates the product for their work.
Such a product can do without marketing and profit distribution effort.

.. _`d7`:

:d7: byproducts

Software created or improved along the product development,
but not directly linked to the product
is released separately with GPL license.
The efforts can still be recorded to the product repo,
because needed by the product.
This procedures produces more free software
which means less organizational overhead
for future products under the econ contract.

.. _`dl`:

:dl: reliability

The contributors

- commit to the product
- plan the product
- work on the product
- finish the product
- own the product
- profit from the product

Finishing the product is essential to be able to interact with the market.
Becoming a contributor

- is an implicit *promise* to the other contributors
- to stick to the product until finished

Contributors concentrate on the product.
Money follows only, if a product is finished.

A dropout contributor still gets money,
if the product is finished,
but the risk of not getting finished is higher.

Reliability reduces effort to reorganize.
Reorganization effort is done by the bottom econ.
Not being reliable

- gives the bottom econ a bigger share of profit
- reduces the overall profit/work ratio

.. _`dprocess`:

Process
-------

Motivated by `pnoboss`_, `pfair`_.

.. _`do`:

:do: equality

In an econ lattice, no one has control over someone else.
There is **no boss**, neither in an econ, nor in the econ lattice.

Control may refer to controlling the product-related content.

Someone initiating or coordinating does not decide, but mediates an agreement.
The less coordination needed, the better.
The `repo`_ should contain all the information
to do without coordination.


.. _`dk`:

:dk: choice

The content is created according `pdt`_ in all layer

- plan: motivate
- do: fix specification (spec)
- test: check actual result with spec

The product to a large part determines the work that needs to be done.

Based on the existing plans in the repo,
*contributors choose work*
from a list of unassigned work in the repo.

There are no predefined roles.

.. _`dp`:

:dp: decision

Decision making is based on the principle:

- *Those decide that have most information*.

Affected others are consulted and informed about the decision.

.. _`dq`:

:dq: legislative

A decision needs a proposal.
The proposal is worked out by the one interested person according `pdt`_.

If more are concerned, decisions are democratic between those concerned, either

- by direct vote or
- through elected or otherwise agreed delegation

The *vote weight* is proportional to the contribution of the content concerned.

Compliance to contracts (this file, license) is not for vote, though.
They are guaranteed by law.
Here changes can only be done unanimously.

.. _`df`:

:df: judicial

Having access to all product information, including `tributes`_ and financial,
all contributors can check fairness.

An additional `ombudsman`_

- actively checks a real implementation against this contract
- handles reported fairness issues or
- mediates other conflicts

.. _`dproduct`:

Product
=======

Motivated by `pproduct`_, `pexisting`_, `popen`_.

The product is the interface between

- the inside market (contributors) and
- the outside market (customers)

Product refers to a physical device with a construction effort.

.. _`d8`:

:d8: info

Information about the product is not the product.
Information in the product repo is for free, i.e. without profit.
The product repo has free `access`_.

Software in the repo is regarded as information
and under GPL-3.0.

.. _`da`:

:da: existing

The product does not need to be a new product type.
An existing price and market is valuable for planning.
The new open development method

- can make a difference on the market
- can open new directions for a product type

If a product type has an econ repo already,
contribute to that repo, possibly also a new version,
instead of creating a new repo.

.. _`d5`:

:d5: conversion

The product is the output item to the outside economy.
There are also input items from the outside economy.
Work refers only to the conversion of input items to the product.

Only product parts that are developed internally require work and thus an econ.

Product parts from the outside economy
require work to select the right item and supplier,
but there is no need for a separate econ.

.. _`dlegal`:

Legal
=====

Motivated by `pleproduct`_, `pnoemployment`_

The econ values are not specific to a government.
They need to be compatible (legal) with all involved governments.

The fact that the econ lattice consists of econs,
allows each econ to be in a different government.
The econ, natural person or legal person, cares to interact with its government.

.. _`d0`:

:d0: general partnership

Legally,
contributors implicitly form a `general partnership`_ under `common or civil law`_
(in German: `Gesellschaft bürgerlichen Rechts`_),
bound by this econ contract.

.. _`d4`:

:d4: license

A license needs to be part of the product repo
to keep away legal liability issues
resulting from usage of the information in the product repo.

The license does not apply to the final product.

.. _`de`:

:de: LE

The bottom econ founds a company
already during development,
if money flow is involved during the development of the product.

`legal entity`_ (LE) refers to the bottom econ as a company,
else *bottom econ* is used (which can still be a person or a group of people).

The `LE`_ cares about product-specific interaction

- with its government
- creditors
- contributors

.. _`dj`:

:dj: per product

The `LE`_ is per product.
A new version of the product has the same `LE`_,
but possibly a changed econ lattice.

.. _`di`:

:di: control

A `LE`_ is only interface (an address)

- for the government
- for the market

Contributors secure control over the `LE`_

- by this econ contract and/or
- by registering as member to the `LE`_,
  if its `legal entity type`_
  gives control to the members by default (`cooperative`_, `joint-stock company`_)

.. _`dg`:

:dg: taxes

The major interest of a government is taxes.

- When selling the product,
  the `VAT`_ is added to the final product,
  if required by the government

- Taxing of the econ is according location of the econ.
  So profit taxation of a product
  spreads over more governments
  with one as a special case.

.. _`dw`:

:dw: cash

All product-related cash flow goes via the `LE`_.
The contributors have control over the financial channels (e.g. bank account),
but it is delegated to the `LE`_ and executed by buyers and sellers,
which register the money flows in the repo,
for everybody to check,
with possible additional checks from specialized fairness checkers.

.. _`dv`:

:dv: court

The government of the `LE`_'s residence
provides the jurisdiction for potential disputes.
That is not an interest of the government,
but rather of the contributors, creditors and product customers.

.. _`d9`:

:d9: no employment

The `LE`_ **does not have employees**, because

| work on a product
| not producing product ownership
| leads to a labor market and
| a separate labor market decouples work from its value
| i.e. the value of the product

In the econ contract

- everything is coupled to the product
- and so is work and its value

Not using employment is the major difference
between the econ lattice and traditional companies.
Profit sharing or advanced payments are usual practices.

The econs working on product parts
are separate entities (natural or legal) and
on purpose outside the control of the product `LE`_.

Accordingly they have their own responsibility to interact with their government,
whether the same or different.

Concentrating the effort of government interaction to saves effort is up to the econs,
as it is no product specific. Econs can contribute to more products.


.. _`dd`:

:dd: founding

Founding a `LE`_ must not produce product ownership.
Only subsequent product-relevant work produces product ownership.

When founding the `LE`_ the `articles of association`_ contain or reference

- a description of the product the `LE`_ is for
- the econ contract
- the representatives
- how members are added or removed later (only for `cooperative`_)
- additional information as required by the government

A reference allows to change the content unanimously without interacting with the government.
Interaction of the government is effort and must be kept minimal.

If the contributors commit to the econ values *by contract*,
and the founders quit contributing or are forced to do so by vote of the contributors,
it produces government interactions to update the `LE`_'s registered data
at the government or bank.

It is therefore better to ensure the econ values via membership in the `LE`_.

- The `cooperative`_ seems to be the only `legal entity type`_
  that only requires a list where members are registered.
  The list of members is stored in the product repo.

- A `joint-stock company`_ satisfies the econ values
  if the `articles of association`_ assure that `tributes`_ are the only `stock`_.

.. _`dy`:

:dy: limited liability

An initial `LE`_ cannot be a `limited liability`_ `LE`_,
unless the founders forward `liable capital`_, e.g. as perpetual `bonds`_.
`Liable capital`_ emphasize its purpose as risk capital without defining product ownership.

There is also probably no need for `limited liability`_
before actually interacting with the outside economy.

It is better therefore to found the  `limited liability`_ `LE`_
only before selling the product,

- by conversion from the existing `LE`_
- by creating an additional production and marketing `LE`_ joining the product econ lattice
- by creating an `LE`_ only when actually producing and marketing

When the product development is finished

- most product owners are known through work done
- the `liable capital`_ can be raised by the contributors so far
- `liable capital`_ overlaps with outside economy's definition of `equity`_,
  but we keep the distinction by continuing to use `liable capital`_.

The `LE`_ takes the responsibility for the product according `limited liability`_.

.. _`dcontent`:

Content
=======

Motivated by: efficiency, `pinfo`_, `pfair`_, `popen`_, `pchoice`_

All product information is

- in a **written** form
- with **URLs**
- over an IT network

to

- spread information
- link information
- allow recording of effort

.. _`dh`:

:dh: repo

All product related content is in one repo (`cohesion`_).

Internal information is `pgp`_-encrypted.
Only the contributors have access to this information.

The repo uses `git`_ as `version control system`_.

The original repo is stored in the cloud with `access <#d6>`_ via an URL.
Modifications (`forks <#ds>`_) do the same.

The product repo contains:

- governance (`LE`_ contact data, values, contributors, `work kinds <#dn>`_, ...)
- financing (expenses, income, `liabilities`_, ...)
- development (hardware, software, test, development docs, usage docs, license, ...)
- production (`SOP`_'s, `DMR`_, `DHF`_, ...)
- marketing

The repo is also a communication channel.

The repo links profit with work via content.
It records and provides information about

- effort
- profit

Folders that do not depend on product version
are kept in a separate "unversioned" git branch: e.g. financing and marketing.

An example layout could look like this::

.. _`d6`:

:d6: access

The registered *contributors* have access to all information.
It allows them

- to do their work (development and production)
- to check the fairness (effort, financing and marketing)
- interact (governance)

*Non-contributors* have also access to all non-encrypted information

- to allow them to choose to contribute
- to avoid repeating effort
- to keep `tributes`_ together with content
  even if the repo is forked

.. _`ds`:

:ds: fork

Access may not mean direct access,
because it would mean too much effort for the bottom econ
to build trust to too many contributors.

Access includes forking and creating pull requests.

The bottom econ needs to react timely to such pull requests.

.. _`dx`:

:dx: merge

All pull requests get merged at least after mediation.
If there is a conflict, e.g. out of differing technical opinions,
a new product version with a new repo branch is created.

.. _`dwork`:

Work
====

Motivated by `pnoemployment`_.

.. _`d2`:

:d2: priceless

The actual value of product-related work
is only determined by the success of the product on the market.
To stop inequality from growing, it is essential

- *not to give a price to product-related work using an outside currency*

The outside price of work is decoupled from the actual value of work
and cannot be a reference.

*Work* does not only refer to technical development of the product,
but to all aspects to make a finished product successful on the market.

.. _`drelevantwork`:

Relevant Work
-------------

Only **relevant work** for the currently sold **product version** matters for the profit distribution.
If new contributors take over, their effort will matter for future product versions.
Previous contributors

- will still get their profit share on relevant work.
- can still check for fairness.

Work is measured by its result.

*Relevancy* requires work to be associated with product parts and thus econs.
When the part is replaced that work becomes irrelevant.
For `diversification`_ people should contribute to more parts.

Work that is not exclusively for the specific product is its own product,
that comes from the outside economy.

.. _`dtribute`:

Tributes
--------

The **econ contract** requires the `LE`_ to care to

- *attribute* to econs the *contribution* to the product
- *distribute* profit proportionally

All these words contain "tribute".
Therefore the product-related unit of work result is called tribute.

Tributes document product ownership.

.. _`dm`:

:dm: tributes

Tributes produce delayed income in an outside currency when the product is sold.
Until then tributes can still be

- donated
- inherited
- used as pledge for a loan,
  if accepted by a creditor
- basically also sold,
  but a price is probably hard to agree upon,
  since the actual value in the outside economy is unknown

.. _`dworkunit`:

Work Units
----------

Product efforts include all product-related activities
up to the shipping of the final product to the customer.

This involves different kinds of work.
Certain work needs more expertise than other.
When quantifying results internally,

- the kind of work has more weight
- than the contributor who does the work

.. _`dt`:

:dt: performance

Measuring the performance of a contributor is depreciative and biased,
as neither experience nor education nor exams
need to reflect in the result.
A less performant contributor will take longer,
i.e. automatically get less profit per time compared to others.
The quality of the result is checked,
therefore fast results of low quality will still take longer to reach accepted quality.

.. _`dn`:

:dn: work kinds

Every kind of work has its own result unit.

*Work kinds* units can be

- lines of a report (steps taken,...)

- lines of a plan (why, requirements, testing, ...)

- number of records per type (account journal, contributors recruited, customers acquired, ...)

- lines of code (described as much as possible with a language, general is preferred over `DSL`_)

To get to a profit distribution key,
the *work kind* units are internally valued against a standard work unit (**tribute** unit).
The *tribute* unit is described
based on an activity that is frequent for the product.

The tribute unit has no exchange rate to an outside currency.

.. _`d1`:

:d1: tribute algorithm

The repo contains an algorithm that 
*automatically* calculates the contributor's tributes from the repo.

This *tribute algorithm* needs to be finalized
latest when pricing the product for the outside market.

Files are ordered by content,
but can be associated by *symbolic links* to

- kind of work
- contributor

Review/change on file(s) of other contributor
is considered by a report file
which is associated to the reviewer or bug fixer.

.. _`dr`:

:dr: precision

How and how precise work is recorded needs to be agreed upon.
There should be an effort in the fair attribution of work,
but how much is decided by the contributors by proposal and vote.
Micro-recording and micro-payments produce more effort than value
and thus produce deficit.
This is true for accounting in general.

.. _`dtools`:

Tools
-----

Tools have an outside economy price.
They can therefore be accounted with that currency.

Product-specific tools are completely accounted to the product.

But to reduce the accounting effort,
cheap and obvious non-product-specific tools can be subsumed by either

- work kind or
- contributor

More expensive non-product-specific tools are accounted separately with the market price.
E.g. a car can considered by the price of renting the car,
even if it is owned by the contributor
when using it for a product-specific work.

Investment in big machines not exclusively for the product,
are outsourced to a separate company.

.. _`dfinancing`:

Financing
=========

Motivated by `pnostock`_ and `pprofit`_.

The major costs for technical products are development.
If developers can afford to wait for the revenue via sale of the finished product,
there is not much money needed.

Smaller expenses can be financed from the contributors.

Financing through `stock`_ cannot be used,
because ownership

- is defined by work (`tributes`_)
- not via capital

Before actual income, the money can come from

- debt e.g. as bonds (`liabilities`_)
- donations

Money *cannot* be used to change ownership of the `LE`_.
Bonds don't change ownership.
The profit through ownership is higher than
the interest on bonds. Also,
the interest on bonds can be considered in the pricing of the product.

Money can change product ownership indirectly,
if a contributor is payed

- to produce tribute and/or
- to forward tribute to the paying party

Contributors probably avoid such relations by

- the prospect of bigger profit if not payed to renounce on ownership
- by possible regular profit `advances`_ granted by the `LE`_

`Advances`_ are loans, which might

- only be possible if the `LE`_ finds creditors
- not be accepted by contributors

Contributors can sell only part of their tributes,
if in need of money.

.. _`dz`:

:dz: profit

profit = income - expenses within a financial period.

Expenses are only those related to the product.

*Work is not an expense*,
because the profit becomes the reward for the work.

Profit from the product sales of the period
is attributed to contributors for every product version.

The profit

- is buffered in the `LE`_ (`retained earnings`_)
- is forwarded to the owners according tributes
- can be reinvested as `bonds`_

.. _`dadvances`:

Advances
--------

Work

- produces ownership and
- delayed profit
- not immediate profit

Profit advances constitute regular payments to owners, currently contributing or not,
to allow them to use products of the outside economy already before revenue from sales of the product.

Advances are only needed if there is no profit yet.

Advances are

- loans of the `LE`_ to the contributor
- are pledged by tributes
- are payed back using profit at the end of the period or forwarded to the next period
- not reward for work (not wages)

Advances must be payed back to the `LE`_,
if the product does never make a profit (e.g. because not completed).
But they might not be recoverable.

The `LE`_ raises advances by donations and `bonds`_.
If the `LE`_ gets bankrupt, `bonds`_ might be lost.
The risk is

- taken by creditors if financed by bonds and
- considered via the interest rate on the bonds

Advances are a compromise for

- risk of third party take-over of contributors
- risk of diminished or no advances
- risk of abandonment of a potentially profitable product

The `LE`_ agrees with the contributors, whether to pay advances.
The amount of advances is agreed separately with every contributor.
The information is in the product repo.
