.. _`Purpose`:

:Purpose:

Ideas from the `inequality`_ blog
are reorganized and extended using `pdt`_:

- `inform`_: introduction and concepts for the context
- `plan`_: ideas and motivations
- `do`_: concrete rules, processes and contracts
- `test`_: feedback mechanisms (monitoring and adaptation)

The focus is on technology.

Economy
=======

.. _`evolution`:

:evolution:

Economic supply and demand corresponds to
creation of and selection from a variable (information processing),
which makes economy comparable to other
`evolutionary systems`_.
Information per time corresponds to energy.
The variables depend on the system, therefore also the type of energy.
In physics as in economy **work** is another name for energy.

`Evolutionary systems`_ produce **encapsulations** to reduce energy consumption.
In the economy, encapsulations down to a person are considered.

.. _`economy`:

:economy:

The purpose of work is to satisfy the person's need.
Maximizing a person's freedom is equivalent to maximizing the person's capital.

A free society is the sum over individual freedom.
Maximizing the society's freedom is equivalent to well distributed capital, i.e.
minimizing inequality.

The purpose of economy is to maximize society's satisfaction.

.. _`money`:

:money:

Money is the valuation (pricing) of work in the economy via products.

Valuation of work has a broad range.
The value of work (interaction) depends on

- who you interact with
- how you interact

Who with and how to maximize the personal work value?

- Who relates to fairness between people and to machines (automation)
- How relates to encapsulation, organizationally and by content

Direct interaction (service) has less choice on optimization.
A better work pricing is achieved via products.

Once priced, the resulting money is a promise of economy
based on all current products and services (`fiat money`_).

Stable money requires

- reliability and
- trust

.. _`inflation`:

The economy is not capable to keep its promise, because

- development of products continues independently (competition)
- humans limited capability to plan ahead

The result is inflation.

The dissipative loss of information makes development non-deterministic.
Nature itself is non-deterministic due to dissipation,
but also due to limited precision (quantum).

Inflation is not seen in the money figure.
Inflation is a change in the unit (currency) with respect to other units.

.. _`interest`:

People should strive to be as reliable as possible,
to be trustworthy economic partners.

Since society is not very reliable,
the money is invested in people (or goods)
that promise to be more reliable than the general economy.
This is encoded in an *interest rate*.

The interest rate should at least balances the inflation rate.

.. _`risk`:

There is a risk associated with every endeavour.
That is the reason of inflation.

Risk can be reduced with accurate planning.

There are physical limits of planning due to limited information.
It is not possible to foresee the effect of an ad,
but it can be measured afterward to change the strategy.

Established products are safer,
because the price and the market is known.
But new product are more profitable.
The profitability of a product can be inferred from the work it allows to save.
Promising products are those that reduce the interactions, the economy.

Planning and development better than the general economy
should reduce the risk below inflation.

.. _`investment`:

:investment:

Any investment in a promising and well planned product
gives a better `return of investment`_
than the general economy.

Work investment is best priced by the product.

Work can be given a current value in money
by comparing with prices of similar work,
if you want to include work in further calculations,
e.g. to calculate your `return of investment`_ on work.

.. _`bookkeeping`:

:bookkeeping:

In bookkeeping money is regarded as conserved,
like conservation of energy.
Money flows from one account to another account (posting),
but does not get lost.
If money actually gets lost,
then there is a "loss" account,
to keep the books in order.
One tries to avoid loss, but sometimes it is unavoidable.

Income and expenses are in exchange of an asset of equivalent value,
which is also recorded to keep the total value unchanged.

For financial reporting required by government at the end of a financial period,
accounts need to be closed by postings balancing input and output.
The closing balance is transferred to an opening balance for the new period.

Bookkeeping hinges on pricing of assets.
Well established prices make bookkeeping more easily fit to reality.
Speculative assets may be priced by expectation, maximum or minimum,
or not priced at all,
depending on what is more favorable for taxation.

Only priced values need to be kept in standard bookkeeping.
Non-priced assets can be recorded separately
and priced later by reality.

Work should be priced by the product's success.

Fairness
========

Everyone wants an easy life,
but it often made harder than necessary,
through competition instead of cooperation.

Cooperation means that everyone interacting makes the other's life easy.
From the personal perspective:

- Everyone makes my life easier.
- I make everyone's life easier.

By choice: I interact with people that make my life easier.
I make their life easier, too.

From cooperation follows a better distribution of effort and reward.
Technically, easier needs to be defined and involves measuring and recording.


.. _`openness`:

:openness:

Information produces fairness.

Information is

- easy to give
- valuable to get

Opening up information is an easy way to make each other's life easier.

Products are developed openly.

This also includes hardware.
Hardware should first be simulated,
but definitely also needs physical prototyping and testing effort.
This is considerable effort that should not need to be repeated.

Development is done by a central repo accessible to everybody.

Outside people can build on existing product development effort.
Their contributions makes them automatically owners of the product.

Construction and marketing is part of the product effort
and is recorded in the central repo,
whether done by the original members or the newcomers.

Sales are forwarded according ownership,
which includes also development and testing effort.

If somebody constructs the product for oneself without selling,
that one has the construction cost only.
But this normally will be higher than buying the mass produced device.

If building the product is cheap, as for software,
then software is not the product,
but the know how to modify and improve the software.

Changes in the central repo might not be accepted in
by the existing developers, e.g. out of differing technical opinions.
Then the contributors can fork the product.
Forking must keep all the records of previous relevant work.
Income from sales are forwarded to owners on every fork.

Existing economic links cannot be forked as easily as a product.
Still, existing owners need to have a good reason not to accept a contribution,
because

- well motivated product forking might also drag along the economic links
- product forks

  - increase effort
  - decrease profit

Benefits of openness:

- People from the outside economy can join the/a product lattice easily

- If joining due to technical interest, this interest can be developed,
  because the invested time is payed

- Formation of a new product lattices by the community is easier

- Development becomes faster (less burocracy, less reinvention)

- The final products becomes more competitive (cheaper, better)

- Creating competing solutions allows to select the best solution

- Customers do get

  - more choice
  - better support by large community
  - can do their special adaptations and possibly contribute them
  - have no risk to lose the supplier because a company get bankrupt
  - can maintain the product for oneself
    even if the community abandons it


.. _`fairness_plan`:

:fairness plan:

Fairness is a development like every other.
Fairness needs to be

- planned, done and tested (`pdt`_) or needs
- legislative, executive and judicial power, if delegated
  (`separation of powers`_)

Fairness development is not specific to a product.
So it is placed in a separate repo (e.g. this repo)
to make it reusable for more product developments.

Members of a product team

- test the rules
- can propose changes

If accepted by vote, the changed plan becomes the new plan,
first locally and, if forwarded, also in the upstream fairness repo.

This is direct legislation.
The planning of the fairness can also be delegated to a *legislative* power.

Practicing fairness in a product team is the direct execution.
One could have an `ombudsman`_ as a delegated *executive* power.
But with direct access to the fairness repo for feedback, it should not be necessary.

With the fairness repo conflicts can be resolved with basic principles
instead of opportunistically improvised arguments.
Conflicts can be resolved directly or mediated through a *judicial* power.

For a small team open information (work share, financial)
allows everyone to check the fairness.

Organization is done per product.
For a larger products the organization is larger.
The associated larger fairness effort motivates delegation.
Since the fairness is not related to a product,
a separate organization can do fairness checks (`audit`_).
